# Grace-Mar — Business Prospectus

**Identity Infrastructure for the Agent Web**

*Version 1.0 · February 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

Grace-Mar defines the **Identity Fork Protocol (IFP)**: a sovereign, evidence-linked, agent-consumable identity layer. Instead of a product, it is a protocol—identity schema, gated staging contract, evidence linking rules, and manifest spec. The reference implementation is open-source; Grace-Mar is the certification authority and governance steward.

**Core doctrine — The Sovereign Merge Rule:** *The agent may stage. It may not merge.* Only the user approves what enters the Record. Trust boundary is architectural, not configurable.

**Positioning:** Grace-Mar is vendor-neutral identity infrastructure. AI schools and platforms consume identity; they do not own it. Families own the Record; agents and platforms read it with consent.

**Dual opportunity:**
1. **Supplemental** — Add user-owned Record layer to Alpha ($40K–$75K/year AI schools) and similar platforms. Record feeds personalization; school events feed pipeline.
2. **Low-cost alternative** — Open-source. Families outside elite tuition run Grace-Mar + Khan/IXL + lightweight structure for $0 software cost.

## Problem

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Agent web has no identity primitive** | Agents need structured, trustworthy identity; today they scrape, infer, or hallucinate |
| **AI schools own the data** | Alpha, Khan, IXL store student data in proprietary systems; families have no portable asset |
| **Evidence ≠ artifacts** | Platforms use engagement metrics; nobody curates artifacts (writing, art, "we did X") with user approval |
| **$40K+ tuition excludes most families** | Elite AI schools prove demand; 99% of families cannot afford them |

---

## Solution

**Record** — Structured, evidence-grounded identity: who they are (SELF) + what they can do (SKILLS).

**Gate (Sovereign Merge Rule)** — The agent may stage; it may not merge. User approves every merge. Trust boundary is architectural, not configurable.

**Evidence grounding** — Every claim traces to artifacts (ACT-XXXX). No LLM inference; no undocumented knowledge.

**Export** — Agent-native interface. Markdown, schema, manifest. Identity can be consumed by Alpha/Incept, OpenClaw, and future agent ecosystems.

## Market Opportunity

| Segment | Size | Grace-Mar Fit |
|---------|------|---------------|
| **Elite AI schools** | Alpha $40K–75K; Astra Nova up to $75K | Supplemental Record layer; integration license |
| **Mid-tier microschools** | Prisma $5K–12K; Synthesis ~$2K/year | Supplemental or alternative |
| **Khan/IXL families** | Khan free; Khanmigo $4/mo; IXL $20/mo | Low-cost alternative; open-source core |
| **Homeschool** | Growing; Alpha homeschool = 1x (motivation bottleneck) | Record + "we did X" = motivation substrate |

**Gap:** No platform provides user-owned, evidence-grounded, portable identity. Grace-Mar fills this across every segment.

---

## Traction & Status

| Milestone | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Architecture** | Complete — Record schema, gated pipeline, three-channel mind (Knowledge, Curiosity, Personality) |
| **Pilot** | Active — pilot-001 (age 6) post-seed; SELF, SKILLS, EVIDENCE populated |
| **Emulation** | Live — Telegram bot; WeChat optional |
| **Pipeline** | Active — analyst stages candidates; user approves; merge to profile |
| **Export** | `export_user_identity.py` → USER.md/SOUL.md for OpenClaw |

## Monetization (Seed Deck)

### Revenue Streams — Priority Order

| Priority | Stream | Target | Price | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| **1** | Hosted service (B2C) | Families, homeschoolers | $8–15/mo or $80–120/yr | No-code Record + Voice; Alpha/Khan/IXL compatible |
| **2** | B2B platform license | AI schools (Alpha, Prisma, Synthesis) | $5–15/student/year or rev share | Identity layer; white-label export |
| **3** | Premium export / integrations | Power users, schools | $50–200/yr | Alpha-compatible, advanced analytics |
| **4** | Certification | Third-party implementations | One-time + annual | Fork-Integrity Verified badge |

### TAM / SAM / SOM (Directional)

| Layer | Segment | Est. Size | Grace-Mar Wedge |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **TAM** | US K–12 students | ~50M | Identity/learning-record infrastructure |
| **SAM** | Homeschool + microschool + AI-school families | ~3–5M students | User-owned Record; homeschool growing 5–30% YoY by state (post-pandemic) |
| **SOM** | Year 1–3: homeschool + Alpha-adjacent | 10K–50K families | Hosted service + 1–2 platform integrations |

### Unit Economics (Target)

| Metric | Assumption |
|--------|------------|
| **ARPU (hosted)** | $100/yr |
| **CAC** | <$50 (organic, content, community) |
| **LTV** | $300+ (3+ year retention; Record compounds) |
| **Gross margin** | 80%+ (software) |
| **Platform (B2B)** | $10/student/year at 1K students = $10K ARR per school |

### Use of Funds (18–24 Month Runway)

| Category | % | Use |
|----------|---|-----|
| **Product** | 40% | Hosted service launch; homeschool docs; Alpha/Incept integration path |
| **Go-to-market** | 30% | Content, community, 1–2 integration pilots |
| **Team** | 25% | 1–2 FTE (product + growth) |
| **Ops / legal** | 5% | Compliance (COPPA), infra |

### Milestones Tied to Capital

| Month | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| 3 | Hosted service MVP (Record + Voice, no GitHub required) |
| 6 | 500+ families; first platform pilot (Alpha-adjacent or microschool) |
| 12 | 5K+ families; B2B contract or LOI |
| 18 | 15K+ families; path to profitability visible |

### Path to First Revenue

1. **Hosted service** — Primary. Families pay for convenience; open core remains free.
2. **Platform pilot** — One Alpha-adjacent or Prisma-style school adopts Grace-Mar as identity layer.
3. **Certification** — Third parties build IFP-compatible systems; Grace-Mar certifies and charges.

## Competitive Moat

| Moat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Evidence grounding** | Every claim traces to artifacts. Competitors use engagement metrics. |
| **Sovereign Merge Rule** | Agent may stage, never merge. User sovereignty architectural. Schools auto-update; IFP never does. |
| **Agent-native interface** | Record structured for consumption; export, schema, manifest. |
| **Portable architecture** | Principles and schema adoptable; Grace-Mar = reference implementation. |
| **Open-source + low-cost** | No $40K tuition. Homeschoolers, public-school families can adopt. |

---

## Ask

**Raise:** Pre-seed / seed ($500K–$1.5M). 18–24 month runway to hosted service, integration pilot, and path to profitability.

**Partners:** AI school platforms (Alpha, Prisma, Synthesis) seeking identity layer; OpenClaw and agent ecosystems needing identity source.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Agent web adoption slower than expected | Grace-Mar works standalone (Record + Voice); identity value persists |
| Competitor copies schema | First-mover; evidence depth; governance maturity; open protocol grows ecosystem |
| Trust incidents | Document security posture; treat agent as adversary; gate non-negotiable |
| User fatigue (approval burden) | Staging automation; lightweight approve/reject; no editing required |
