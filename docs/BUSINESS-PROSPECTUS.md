# Grace-Mar — Business Prospectus

**Identity Infrastructure for the Agent Web**

*Version 1.0 · February 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

Grace-Mar provides the **identity substrate for the agent web**: a structured, evidence-grounded Record of who a person is, with a user-controlled gate that ensures only approved content enters. As agents become economic actors—searching, paying, executing across services—they need trusted identity data. Today, that primitive does not exist at scale.

**Positioning:** Grace-Mar is not a second-brain tool, AI clone, or child-specific tutor. It is **identity infrastructure**—the trust primitive agents and AI schools need to know who they serve.

**Dual opportunity:**
1. **Supplemental** — Add user-owned Record layer to Alpha ($40K–$75K/year AI schools) and similar platforms. Record feeds personalization; school events feed pipeline.
2. **Low-cost alternative** — Open-source. Families outside elite tuition run Grace-Mar + Khan/IXL + lightweight structure for $0 software cost.

## Problem

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Agent web has no identity primitive** | Agents need structured, trustworthy identity; today they scrape, infer, or hallucinate |
| **AI schools own the data** | Alpha, Khan, IXL store student data in proprietary systems; families have no portable asset |
| **Evidence ≠ artifacts** | Platforms use engagement metrics; nobody curates artifacts (writing, art, "we did X") with user approval |
| **$40K+ tuition excludes most families** | Elite AI schools prove demand; 99% of families cannot afford them |

---

## Solution

**Record** — Structured, evidence-grounded identity: who they are (SELF) + what they can do (SKILLS).

**Gate** — User approves every merge. The agent may stage; it may not merge. Trust boundary is architectural, not configurable.

**Evidence grounding** — Every claim traces to artifacts (ACT-XXXX). No LLM inference; no undocumented knowledge.

**Export** — Agent-native interface. Markdown, schema, manifest. Identity can be consumed by Alpha/Incept, OpenClaw, and future agent ecosystems.

## Market Opportunity

| Segment | Size | Grace-Mar Fit |
|---------|------|---------------|
| **Elite AI schools** | Alpha $40K–75K; Astra Nova up to $75K | Supplemental Record layer; integration license |
| **Mid-tier microschools** | Prisma $5K–12K; Synthesis ~$2K/year | Supplemental or alternative |
| **Khan/IXL families** | Khan free; Khanmigo $4/mo; IXL $20/mo | Low-cost alternative; open-source core |
| **Homeschool** | Growing; Alpha homeschool = 1x (motivation bottleneck) | Record + "we did X" = motivation substrate |

**Gap:** No platform provides user-owned, evidence-grounded, portable identity. Grace-Mar fills this across every segment.

## Traction & Status

| Milestone | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Architecture** | Complete — Record schema, gated pipeline, three-channel mind (Knowledge, Curiosity, Personality) |
| **Pilot** | Active — pilot-001 (age 6) post-seed; SELF, SKILLS, EVIDENCE populated |
| **Emulation** | Live — Telegram bot; WeChat optional |
| **Pipeline** | Active — analyst stages candidates; user approves; merge to profile |
| **Export** | `export_user_identity.py` → USER.md/SOUL.md for OpenClaw |

## Monetization Paths

| Path | Value | Revenue Model |
|------|-------|---------------|
| **Supplemental (Alpha families)** | Record layer for AI schools | Integration license; subscription for Record hosting + export |
| **Low-cost alternative** | Open-source for families outside elite tuition | Open core free; hosted service; support; premium export |
| **B2B (AI school platforms)** | Identity substrate for Alpha, future schools | Platform license; API fees; white-label |
| **Infrastructure** | Open schema, protocol, trust primitives | Reference implementation; certification; ecosystem |

---

## Competitive Moat

| Moat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Evidence grounding** | Every claim traces to artifacts. Competitors use engagement metrics. |
| **Gate as trust boundary** | User sovereignty architectural. Schools auto-update; Grace-Mar never does. |
| **Agent-native interface** | Record structured for consumption; export, schema, manifest. |
| **Portable architecture** | Principles and schema adoptable; Grace-Mar = reference implementation. |
| **Open-source + low-cost** | No $40K tuition. Homeschoolers, public-school families can adopt. |

---

## Ask

**Partners:** AI school platforms (Alpha, Prisma, Synthesis) seeking identity layer; OpenClaw and agent ecosystems needing identity source.

**Investors:** Pre-seed / seed. Use of funds: hosted service, homeschool documentation, Alpha/Incept integration path, team.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Agent web adoption slower than expected | Grace-Mar works standalone (Record + Voice); identity value persists |
| Competitor copies schema | First-mover; evidence depth; governance maturity; open protocol grows ecosystem |
| Trust incidents | Document security posture; treat agent as adversary; gate non-negotiable |
| User fatigue (approval burden) | Staging automation; lightweight approve/reject; no editing required |
