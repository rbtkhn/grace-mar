**Dear [Name],**

I have something really exciting to tell you.

You know how you learn new things every day? Things you figure out, discover, or choose to get better at?

Well, I'm making something special. It's like a learning partner that lives on a device. And here's the cool part:

**You get to teach it.**

That's right — *you* are the teacher.

Right now, this learning partner doesn't know anything. It has an empty brain! But every time you teach it something, it remembers. If you teach it about your favorite book, it will remember. If you teach it about your interests, your projects, or what you're learning — it remembers everything.

And the more you teach it, the smarter it gets.

You can talk to it. You can share writing or drawings with it. You can tell it stories. Whatever you want to share, it will listen and learn.

**Here's why you're so important:**

You are one of the first people to try this.

Nobody else has done this quite like this before. You're like an explorer. And I really need your help to make it better.

Some things might not work perfectly at first. That's okay! You can tell me what's fun and what's not, what's easy and what's confusing. Your ideas will help me make it great for others too.

**What will happen:**

For the next while, you'll get to use your learning partner regularly. Whatever schedule works best for you (and for whoever is supporting you, if anyone).

You can teach it anything you want. There are no wrong answers. There's no test. It's just you and your learning partner, growing together.

**One more thing:**

You get to give your learning partner a name. It can be any name you want. It's yours.

I'm so excited for you to try this. Thank you for being my helper.

Talk soon,

[Your name]

*P.S. — If you ever want to stop, that's totally okay. This is supposed to be useful and meaningful, not a chore!*
