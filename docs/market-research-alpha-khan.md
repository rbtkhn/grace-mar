## 1. Alpha School

### Profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Model** | AI-powered K-12 microschool network |
| **Tuition** | $40,000/year (base); ~$75,000 in San Francisco |
| **Academics** | 2–3 hours/day; 99th percentile claims; mastery-based |
| **Tech stack** | Incept (proprietary AI), Trilogy Software, Khan Academy, IXL |
| **Locations** | Austin, San Francisco, Miami, LA, Washington DC, Dallas; expanding to NY, Charlotte, Tampa, Scottsdale, Puerto Rico (2025–26) |
| **Differentiator** | Interest graph + knowledge graph; AI generates personalized lessons; guides (not teachers); life skills workshops |

### What Alpha Does Well

- One-to-one mastery-based tutoring at scale (AI)
- Interest-aligned content (e.g., Avengers + soccer buddies in reading)
- Zone of proximal development; 85% challenge sweet spot
- Motivation systems (Alpha Bucks, unlocks, team activities)
- Life skills: sailing, entrepreneurship, financial literacy
- 2x learning at 1/5 the time (internal claims)

### What Alpha Does Not Provide

- **User-owned Record** — Data lives in Alpha's platform
- **Evidence grounding** — Metrics and engagement, not artifacts
- **Portability** — No export of identity/interest/personality
- **Gate** — System auto-updates; no user approval
- **Cross-context** — School-centric; no home/Telegram/artifact integration

### Grace-Mar Fit

- **Supplemental:** Record feeds Incept; school events stage to pipeline
- **Alternative:** Out of reach for most families at $40K–75K; Grace-Mar + Khan/IXL = low-cost substitute

## 3. Khan Academy & Khanmigo

### 3.1 Khan Academy (Core)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | Free |
| **Content** | Math, science, reading, test prep, coding, humanities |
| **Model** | Video + practice; mastery-based; adaptive |
| **Reach** | Global; nonprofit |

### 3.2 Khanmigo (AI Tutor)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | $4/month or $44/year (learners, parents); free for teachers (US) |
| **Approach** | Socratic; guides to answers, doesn't give them |
| **Features** | Tutoring, writing/debate practice, coding, college coaching (parents) |
| **Limitation** | US only for paid; math computation issues (WSJ 2024) |
| **Rating** | 4 stars (Common Sense Media) |

### What Khan Does Well

- Free core content; low-cost AI ($4/mo)
- Trusted brand; safety-focused
- Integrated with curriculum
- Socratic pedagogy

### What Khan Does Not Provide

- **Identity Record** — Tracks progress, not who the child is
- **Interest graph** — No structured personality/curiosity layer
- **Evidence from artifacts** — No writing samples, artwork, "we did X"
- **Portability** — Data in Khan's system
- **User gate** — No approval step for what "counts"

### Grace-Mar Fit

**Ideal low-cost stack:** Khan Academy (free) + Khanmigo ($4/mo) + Grace-Mar (open-source) = full academic + identity layer at ~$48/year software cost. Grace-Mar provides what Khan cannot: user-owned Record, evidence grounding, export, Voice.

## 4. Adaptive Learning Platforms (Content Layer)

| Platform | Cost (Family) | Focus | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|------|
| **IXL** | $63–$127/year | Math, LA, Science, SS | Alpha uses this; comprehensive |
| **DreamBox** | $100–$150/year (12 mo) | Math | $20/student/year for schools |
| **i-Ready** | School contract | Math, reading | Diagnostic + adaptive |

**Grace-Mar fit:** These are content/delivery. Grace-Mar is identity/evidence. Stack: IXL or DreamBox + Grace-Mar = adaptive content + Record.

---

## 5. Free / Open-Source AI Tutoring

| Platform | Cost | Focus | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|------|
| **Open TutorAI** | Free (open-source) | General | Personalized paths, collaborative |
| **Flexi** | Free | Science, math | "AI tutor for every student" |

**Grace-Mar fit:** Open-source + open-source = fully free stack. Grace-Mar + Open TutorAI or Flexi = $0 software cost. Grace-Mar adds Record, evidence, Voice.

---

## 6. Market Gap: Identity Ownership

### Current State

- **Student portraits / learner profiles** exist in research and policy (e.g., Australia, Mastery Transcript)
- **Parent-managed profiles** are advocated (Getting Smart 2015) but not widely implemented
- **Data ownership** is contested; LIFE with AI Act proposes stronger consent/opt-out
- **No platform** combines: (1) user-owned, (2) evidence-grounded, (3) portable, (4) agent-consumable

### Grace-Mar's Unique Position

| Need | Alpha | Khan | Prisma | Grace-Mar |
|------|-------|------|--------|-----------|
| User-owned Record | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✓ |
| Evidence from artifacts | ❌ | ❌ | Partial | ✓ |
| Gate (user approves) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✓ |
| Portable export | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✓ |
| Agent-consumable | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✓ |
| Open-source | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✓ |

## 8. Strategic Implications for Grace-Mar

### Supplemental Positioning

- **Alpha/Prisma/Synthesis families:** Add Grace-Mar for portable, evidence-grounded Record
- **Value prop:** "Your child's identity, owned by you. Feeds their school's AI. Survives school changes."

### Low-Cost Alternative Positioning

- **Stack:** Grace-Mar + Khan (free) + Khanmigo ($4/mo) = ~$48/year
- **Or:** Grace-Mar + IXL (~$127) or DreamBox (~$100)
- **Or:** Grace-Mar + Open TutorAI = $0
- **Value prop:** "Alpha-style identity architecture at 1/1000th the cost."

### Integration Targets

1. **Alpha/Incept** — Record export for personalization
2. **Khan Academy** — No formal integration; Grace-Mar complements
3. **Prisma** — Project artifacts → pipeline; Record as portfolio backbone
4. **Homeschool co-ops** — Grace-Mar as shared identity layer
5. **Prenda guides** — Record for ESA-funded microschools
