# Pilot Plan

## Overview

- **Phase 1**: Solo pilot with 1 student (age 6), 2 months
- **Phase 2**: Expand to 5 additional students, 2 months

## Phase 1: Solo Pilot

### Goals

| Goal | What We're Validating |
|------|----------------------|
| **Engagement** | Will a 6-year-old want to teach the system repeatedly? |
| **Comprehension** | Does she understand the concept of "teaching" the fork? |
| **Learning capture** | Does the system accurately reflect what she knows? |
| **Recognition** | Can parent recognize the student through the fork's responses? |
| **Parent trust** | Does the parent see value and feel comfortable? |
| **Interaction model** | What modalities work? (voice, drawing, typing, video) |
| **Session rhythm** | How long? How often? What triggers engagement? |

### Metrics

**Quantitative:**
- Sessions per week (target: 3-5)
- Average session length (hypothesis: 5-15 min for 6-year-old)
- Return rate (comes back voluntarily?)
- Knowledge nodes created per week
- Query accuracy (when parent queries the fork, is it accurate?)

**Qualitative:**
- Does she enjoy it or treat it as a chore?
- What does she call the fork? (naming = attachment)
- What does she want to teach? (follows curriculum or goes rogue?)
- What frustrates her?
- What delights her?
- **Recognition test**: Does parent say "that sounds like her" when querying the fork?

### MVP Scope

**Include:**
- Teaching interface (voice + simple text + drawing)
- Simple "what the fork knows" view
- Basic parent dashboard
- Parent can query the fork
- Basic timestamps
- iPad app

**Exclude:**
- Complex curriculum structure
- Sophisticated visualization
- Detailed analytics
- Employer/evaluator access
- Full verification stack
- Android, web, wearables

### Timeline

**Week 1-2: Onboarding**
- Introduce concept ("teaching your learning friend")
- Preference survey (movies, books, places, etc.)
- First teaching sessions (guided, with parent)
- Name the fork (her choice)

**Week 3-4: Routine Building**
- Establish session rhythm (after school? before bed?)
- Expand to independent teaching (less parent involvement)
- Test different modalities
- First "query" test (parent queries the fork with something she taught)

**Week 5-6: Depth Testing**
- Can she teach something complex (multi-step)?
- Does she remember what she taught?
- Does the fork remember accurately?
- What does she want to teach vs. what you expected?

**Week 7-8: Assessment**
- Parent interview
- Child interview (with parent present)
- System review
- Decision: ready to expand or iterate?

### Success Criteria (Go/No-Go for Phase 2)

| Metric | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| Sessions per week | ≥3 |
| Voluntary engagement | >50% initiated by her |
| Query accuracy | >80% |
| **Recognition** | Parent says "that sounds like her" when querying the fork |
| Parent sentiment | Positive; would recommend |
| Child sentiment | Wants to continue; names the fork |
| Retention | Still engaged in week 8 |

## Phase 2: Cohort Pilot (5 Additional Students)

### Selection Criteria

| Dimension | Diversity to Seek |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Age range** | 6-8 (stay young) |
| **Gender** | Mix |
| **Learning style** | Visual, auditory, kinesthetic |
| **School type** | Traditional, Montessori, homeschool |
| **Parent involvement** | High-touch vs. hands-off |
| **Geography** | 2+ countries if possible |

### What We're Testing

- Does it work across different children?
- What variations in interaction emerge?
- Does sibling/peer dynamic help?
- What's the parent onboarding need?
- What curriculum patterns emerge?
- What breaks at 6 users?

### Timeline

**Week 1-2:** Individual onboarding
**Week 3-4:** Independent usage, gather data
**Week 5-6:** Introduce optional cohort features
**Week 7-8:** Assessment, interviews

## Data Collection

### Automatic (Session Logs)
- Timestamp, duration, modality
- Content taught
- Queries and responses
- Parent activity

### Weekly (Parent Survey)
- 5-minute check-in
- Observed engagement
- Concerns
- Notable moments

### Bi-weekly (Interviews)
- 15-minute parent call
- 5-minute child conversation

### End-of-Pilot
- 30-minute parent deep dive
- Structured observation session
- NPS and willingness to pay

## Pre-Pilot Checklist

- [ ] iPad with app installed
- [ ] Parent consent and expectations set
- [ ] Recording consent (for research)
- [ ] Baseline interview (what does she know now?)
- [ ] Preference survey completed
- [ ] Session rhythm agreed
