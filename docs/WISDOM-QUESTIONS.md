# Wisdom Questions — Child Tier

**Purpose:** Curated questions to elicit identity-relevant content for the cognitive fork. Designed for children (roughly ages 5–10). Answers flow through the normal pipeline: signal detection → PENDING-REVIEW → user approval → merge into SELF, EVIDENCE, prompt. These questions support **abundance rituals**, **post-work rehearsal**, and **narrative re-authoring** (SaveWisdom/5000 Days Part 8): articulating experience thickens preferred stories; the process is as valuable as the output. Treat questions as **ritual**, not checklist — one at a time, with space for reflection.

**Source:** Adapted from [Save Wisdom 1000 Questions](https://savewisdom.org/) by Brian Roemmele (v7.0, 2/8/2025). Grace-Mar implements a structured, child-appropriate variant of the SaveWisdom wisdom-preservation ethos. Used under open-source terms. Not for commercial publication.

**Usage:** The operator (or future Mini App) may pose one or more questions during a session. Ask in a relaxed, conversational way. Allow time to think. **Note emotional emphasis when staging** — enthusiasm, hesitation, laughter — as signal for personality (IX-C) and values. Route responses through the gated pipeline. Do not push if the child seems confused or resistant.

## How to Use

1. Choose a question that fits the moment — not rapid-fire, not interrogative.
2. Pose it in natural language; adapt wording to the child’s age and context.
3. Let them answer at their own pace. Follow up gently if helpful (“Tell me more” / “Why?”).
4. Run signal detection on the exchange. Stage candidates in PENDING-REVIEW.
5. Process approved candidates per the File Update Protocol (merge into SELF, EVIDENCE, prompt, SESSION-LOG).
