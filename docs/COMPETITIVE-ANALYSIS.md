## Differentiation: cog-em vs. Market

| Dimension | Competitors | cog-em |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Direction** | System captures *from* you | Student teaches *to* system |
| **Function** | Productivity/memory tool | Living credential |
| **Target** | Adults/professionals | Children → adults |
| **Core metaphor** | "Second brain" | "Cognitive fork" |
| **Portability** | Single system | Cross-border, cross-curriculum |
| **Time horizon** | Recent memory | 12+ year relationship |

## White Space

The market validates "AI that knows me." The gaps:

1. **Education/child segment**: Most competitors target adults
2. **Student teaches system**: Everyone else does the reverse
3. **Credential function**: No one offers queryable living credential
4. **Cross-border portability**: Credentials remain siloed

## Closest Competitors to Watch

1. **AllKids AI**: App → robot, evolves with child (closest vision, but robotics focus)
2. **TwinMind**: Well-funded "second brain" (adult/productivity, not education)
3. **Cogniti**: "AI doubles" of professors (inverse: professor → student)
4. **Kin**: Emotional intelligence + personal growth (adult-focused)
