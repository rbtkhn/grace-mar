# Companion Artistic Style Survey

**Purpose:** Probe the companion's (the human's) artistic style to supplement what is already documented. Use when you want to understand how the companion creates, what they prefer, and how they relate to art — for context, continuity, or future companion profiling.

**Ask one question at a time.** Pause for an answer before showing the next. Adapt wording in conversation; the options are for capture.

---

## How to use

1. Ask **one question per turn**. Do not show the full list at once.
2. Read the question aloud (or send it); offer the letter options if the companion prefers to choose.
3. Log the response (letter and any free-text) in the capture section or SESSION-LOG.
4. Optional: note tone (e.g. quick pick vs. hesitation, "that's hard—both") for personality/values signal.

**Where responses may go:** MEMORY (ephemeral context), SESSION-LOG (session record), or a companion-notes file if you create one. No merge into the Record (SELF/EVIDENCE) unless you later define a companion profile and pipeline.

## After the survey

- Log the session in **SESSION-LOG.md** (e.g. "Session 0XX — Companion artistic style survey") with date, method, and summary of responses.
- Optionally add a short summary to **MEMORY.md** (e.g. "Companion art: prefers X, creates when Y") if it helps session continuity; MEMORY is ephemeral.
- No pipeline staging unless you later define a companion Record and merge policy.
