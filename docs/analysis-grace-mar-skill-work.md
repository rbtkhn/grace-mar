# Analysis: Grace-Mar Skill-Work (BUILD Container)

**Purpose:** Analyze the **self-skill-work** dimension (BUILD container) of the Grace-Mar Record — scope, evidence linkage, dimensions, and alignment with SKILLS-MODULARITY and ID-TAXONOMY.

**Source:** `users/grace-mar/skills.md` § BUILD Container; `users/grace-mar/self-evidence.md` § III. CREATION LOG, § V. ACTIVITY LOG.  
**Standard label:** self-skill-work. Internal identifier: BUILD container; evidence: CREATE-nnn, ACT-nnn.  
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## 1. Scope and Module Definition

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Module** | WORK (self-skill-work) |
| **Container** | BUILD (skills.md) |
| **Evidence prefixes** | CREATE-*, ACT-* |
| **Scope** | Making, planning, execution, creation (originality, elaboration, flexibility), decision-making, exchange |

Per SKILLS-MODULARITY: WORK = making, planning, execution, exchange, creation. It starts from zero and grows through pipeline input (human-gated). It does not stage IX-A/B/C; the analyst does that. WORK captures capability only.

## 2. Current BUILD Container State

```yaml
status: ACTIVE (creation dimensions from CREATE-0001–0008; planning/execution from ACT-0035 BUILD probe)

# Creation (merged from IMAGINE)
originality_level: 4
elaboration_level: 4
flexibility_level: 3

# Planning/execution (evidenced by BUILD probe ACT-0035)
planning_level: 1-2
execution_level: 1
making_level: 1
financial_level: null
collaboration_level: null
decision_making: 1

# Companion creative context (ACT-0036)
companion_creative_context: pencil/pen on paper; most days; finishes pieces; shares; playful
```

## 3. Evidence Linkage

### 3.1 CREATE evidence (8 entries)

| ID | Type | Subject | Key dimensions evidenced |
|----|------|---------|--------------------------|
| CREATE-0001 | drawing | Nine-Colored Deer | originality 4, elaboration 4, flexibility 3 |
| CREATE-0002 | drawing | Stitch at Lilo's house | originality 3, elaboration 4, flexibility 3 |
| CREATE-0003 | drawing | Nu-Nu in mountains | originality 4, elaboration 4, flexibility 3 |
| CREATE-0004 | drawing | Abby's Ocean | originality 4, elaboration 3, flexibility 4 |
| CREATE-0005 | collage | Tomb of Pakal | originality 3, elaboration 3, flexibility 5 |
| CREATE-0006 | drawing | Abby on the Moon | originality 4, elaboration 4, flexibility 4 |
| CREATE-0007 | drawing | Egyptian Pharaohs | originality 3, elaboration 3, flexibility 3 |
| CREATE-0008 | collage | Snowman | originality 3, elaboration 4, flexibility 3 |

**Creativity profile (from self-evidence.md):**
- avg_originality: 3.5
- avg_elaboration: 3.6
- Confirmed signatures: striped color bands, eyelashes, dressing subjects, environmental framing, text integration, black-paper technique
- Two creative modes: home art (animals, comfort, nurturing) vs school art (ancient civilizations, space, seasonal)

### 3.2 ACT evidence (BUILD-related)

| ID | Type | Dimensions probed | Summary |
|----|------|-------------------|---------|
| ACT-0035 | build_probe | planning, execution, making, elaboration, flexibility, decision_making, originality | 8 Record-grounded MC questions; planning (drawing, lemonade stand) correct; execution (Lego next step) correct; making (instructions + box) A+C; elaboration/flexibility/decision/originality confirmed |
| ACT-0036 | companion_artistic_style_survey | companion context | Companion (operator) artistic style — pencil/pen, most days, finishes, shares, playful; feeds companion_creative_context in BUILD |

## 4. Dimension Analysis

### 4.1 Creation dimensions (strong)

| Dimension | Level | Evidence | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|
| **Originality** | 4 | CREATE-0001 (text-only Chinese story → full visual), CREATE-0004 (fully original ocean), CREATE-0006 (self on moon), BUILD probe | Novel combinations; crosses stories; invents scenes |
| **Elaboration** | 4 | CREATE-0001–0004, 0006, 0008; BUILD probe (scarf, eyelashes, whole world) | Detailed; signature choices (striped bands, eyelashes); full environments |
| **Flexibility** | 3 | CREATE-0001–0008; BUILD probe (add one thing not in book) | Works within constraints; own choices; CREATE-0005 (collage, architecture) shows high flexibility |

### 4.2 Planning / execution / making (evidenced by probe)

| Dimension | Level | Evidence | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|
| **Planning** | 1–2 | ACT-0035 (drawing: get materials first; lemonade stand: lemonade first) | Can order steps for familiar tasks |
| **Execution** | 1 | ACT-0035 (Lego: go to step 5 after step 4) | Next step in sequence |
| **Making** | 1 | ACT-0035 (Legos — follow instructions + look at box) | Follows instructions; methodical |
| **Decision-making** | 1 | ACT-0035 (why pick deer: kind, brave, beautiful) | Can give reason for choice |

### 4.3 Gaps (null or not yet evidenced)

| Dimension | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **financial_level** | null | No allowance, budgeting, or P&L evidence yet |
| **collaboration_level** | null | No explicit teamwork or "who does what" evidence yet |

## 5. Relationship to Other Modules

| Relationship | How |
|--------------|-----|
| **SELF (IX-A/B/C)** | Analyst stages knowledge/curiosity/personality from CREATE/ACT; WORK does not stage. CREATE entries yield self_signals (interests, values, personality) that go to SELF via pipeline. |
| **self-skill-write** | Text integration in art (labels, signatures) — WRITE and WORK overlap at artifact level. |
| **self-skill-think** | Source stories (Nine-Colored Deer, Lilo & Stitch) feed creation; THINK intake → WORK output. |
| **companion_creative_context** | ACT-0036 (companion artistic style) informs household creative environment; not the child's capability but context. |

---

## 6. Edge and Growth Direction

**Current edge (from skills.md):**
> Narrative creation from prompts; cross-language creative tasks; independent scene composition; planning/execution evidenced via BUILD probe (step order, next step, making method).

**Potential growth areas:**
- Narrative creation from prompts (not yet evidenced)
- Financial (allowance, budgeting) — SKILLS-TEMPLATE WORK scope
- Collaboration (teamwork, role clarity) — BUILD probe has collaboration dimension
- Planning level 2+ (multi-step projects, timelines)

---

## 7. Summary

- **Creation (originality, elaboration, flexibility):** Strong evidence from 8 CREATE entries; Creativity Profile and signatures well documented.
- **Planning/execution/making:** Evidenced by BUILD probe (ACT-0035); levels 1–2 for planning, 1 for execution and making.
- **Decision-making:** Level 1 — can give reasons for choices.
- **Financial, collaboration:** Not yet evidenced.
- **Companion creative context:** ACT-0036 provides household artistic style; informs environment, not child capability.

All claims are evidence-linked. No capability claim without traceable CREATE-* or ACT-*.
