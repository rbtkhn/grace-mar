# Grace-Mar Business Plan

**Execution Plan for Identity Infrastructure**

*Version 1.0 · February 2026*

---

## 1) Executive Summary

Grace-Mar builds user-owned identity infrastructure for the agent web: a structured Record (`SELF`, `SKILLS`, `EVIDENCE`) governed by the Sovereign Merge Rule.

Business objective for the next 18 months:
- prove repeatable family adoption in a hosted product,
- demonstrate measurable trust/continuity outcomes,
- complete 1-2 scoped paid integration pilots.

This document is the operating and commercialization plan.  
For narrative/technical context, see `WHITE-PAPER.md`.  
For concise investor framing, see `BUSINESS-PROSPECTUS.md`.

## 2) Problem and Market Need

Current AI learning stacks have personalization gains, but identity-governance gaps:
- learner context is fragmented across tools and sessions,
- profile claims are often inferred rather than artifact-backed,
- families and operators lack an explicit merge gate and audit trail,
- continuity breaks when learners switch tools, schools, or channels.

Grace-Mar addresses this as a trust and continuity layer, not a tutoring replacement.

---

## 3) Product Scope and Positioning

### What Grace-Mar is
- identity substrate for agents and learning systems,
- evidence-linked profile pipeline with explicit human authority,
- export layer for downstream platform and agent consumption.

### What Grace-Mar is not
- a full LMS or curriculum platform,
- an autonomous profile writer,
- a closed, platform-owned identity graph.

### Positioning strategy
- **Supplemental:** works alongside AI schools/platforms (they teach; Grace-Mar records).
- **Low-cost alternative path:** open-source architecture for families outside elite tuition.

---

## 4) Strategy and Sequencing (0-36 months)

### Phase 1: Proof (0-18 months)
- launch hosted family product with stable onboarding and weekly usage cadence,
- harden trust operations (gate integrity, event completeness, evidence linkage),
- run 1-2 paid pilots with bounded integration surfaces.

### Phase 2: Scale (18-36 months)
- expand integrations after pilot evidence,
- standardize implementation playbooks and operator reporting,
- activate certification/compliance program only after ecosystem pull.

Sequencing rule: retain focus on proof before broad platform claims.

---

## 5) Customer Segments and ICP

### Primary ICP (near-term)
- homeschool/microschool families,
- multi-tool users (Khan/IXL/tutors/AI copilots) with continuity pain,
- high preference for ownership, provenance, and portability.

### Secondary ICP (pilot partners)
- AI-forward schools and operator networks,
- product/learning-science leads needing explainable profile governance,
- organizations with explicit operator/guardian trust and compliance requirements.

---

## 6) Go-to-Market Plan (First 12 Months)

### Channels
| Channel | Why it fits | Leading indicator |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Homeschool communities | concentrated continuity pain + peer trust | waitlist to activation rate |
| Educator creators/newsletters | efficient education funnel | cost per activated family |
| Parent referrals | Record value compounds over time | referral share of new activations |

### Funnel operating targets (working model)
- activation: increase first-week completion of capture -> stage -> review loop,
- retention: focus on week-4 and month-3 cohort depth,
- trust: maintain high evidence-linked claim ratio and low unresolved queue age.

---

## 7) Product and Operations Plan

### Core workflow to operationalize
1. Artifact capture
2. Candidate staging
3. Human review
4. Approved merge
5. Export refresh (PRP/manifest/intent surfaces)

### Operating rhythms
- weekly pipeline health review,
- biweekly product + trust controls checkpoint,
- monthly retention and unit-economics review against assumptions.

### Team priorities
- product engineering: reliability, operator UX, integration boundaries,
- trust operations: merge receipts/events/compliance artifacts,
- GTM: channel tests, pilot packaging, partner enablement.

---

## 8) Monetization Model

### Near-term revenue sequence
1. Hosted family subscription
2. Paid integration pilots
3. Premium operator workflows/controls

### Initial pricing bands (planning)
| Offer | Price band | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Family hosted | $8-15/month or $80-120/year | primary recurring revenue base |
| Pilot package | fixed scoped fee | depends on segment and integration surface |
| Premium exports/workflows | $50-200/year | advanced users and operators |

### Deferred revenue paths
- broader platform licensing,
- certification program revenue.

Activation triggers: repeatable pilot outcomes and validated retention/trust metrics.

---

## 9) Financial Model (Assumptions and Scenarios)

This plan uses transparent assumptions, not asserted outcomes.

### Base operating assumptions (12-month planning)
- free-to-paid conversion: 8-12%
- monthly paid churn: 2.5-4.0%
- ARPU: ~100 USD annualized
- gross margin: 75-85%
- CAC: 40-90 USD (channel-dependent)

### Scenario framing
- **Conservative:** slower conversion, higher churn, longer pilot cycle
- **Base:** assumptions above
- **Upside:** stronger referrals, lower CAC, faster pilot-to-expansion conversion

Assumptions are reviewed quarterly and replaced by observed values.

---

## 10) Pilot Program Plan (Operator-Facing)

### Standard pilot shape
- duration: 8-12 weeks,
- scope: one learner segment, one bounded workflow,
- cadence: weekly operating review + biweekly exec checkpoint,
- outputs: pilot report with go/extend/stop recommendation.

### Joint scorecard
- time-to-action from artifact to approved profile update,
- evidence-linked claim percentage,
- queue completion rate and queue age,
- trust signal (family/operator confidence),
- engagement depth and repeat workflow usage.

See `PILOT-ONE-SHEET.md` for partner-facing summary.

---

## 11) Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Scope dilution | enforce sequencing (family proof first, then integrations) |
| Approval burden fatigue | triage, batching, and operator workflow UX improvements |
| Competitor feature copying | compete on governance operations and longitudinal evidence quality |
| Compliance drag | build trust artifacts and role boundaries in parallel with GTM |
| Unsourced forecasting | treat all economics as assumptions until measured |

---

## 12) Compliance and Trust Posture

Grace-Mar treats trust controls as product requirements:
- explicit human merge authority,
- evidence linkage and provenance,
- append-only event visibility,
- role-scoped access patterns,
- export-first portability model.

This supports family and controlled-adoption contexts where control and auditability are adoption-critical.

---

## 13) Capital Plan and Use of Funds

### Raise objective
- pre-seed/seed range: 500K-1.5M USD
- runway target: 18-24 months

### Planned allocation bands
- 40% product and integration engineering
- 30% GTM and pilot delivery
- 20% trust/compliance operations
- 10% legal and governance hardening

Allocation is staged against milestone completion, not time alone.

---

## 14) Milestones and Decision Gates

### 12-month milestones
- hosted MVP with repeatable onboarding,
- sustained weekly pipeline health,
- at least one completed paid pilot with reportable outcomes,
- operator playbook ready for repeat deployment.

### End-of-phase gates
- **Scale:** metrics meet thresholds and partner fit is confirmed
- **Extend:** partial success with defined remediation plan
- **Stop/pivot:** weak operational lift or trust outcomes

---

## 15) Document Alignment and Ownership

This plan is aligned with:
- `BUSINESS-PROSPECTUS.md` (investor summary),
- `BUSINESS-ROADMAP.md` (strategic priorities and metrics),
- `WHITE-PAPER.md` (narrative and technical context),
- `PILOT-ONE-SHEET.md` (pilot partner handout).

Update cadence:
- monthly operating updates,
- quarterly assumptions and milestone refresh,
- major-version update after each completed pilot cycle.
