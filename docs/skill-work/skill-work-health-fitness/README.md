# Skill-work-health-fitness

**Objective:** Optimize health and fitness of Grace-Mar's human companion — the person whose Record it is, who holds authority in the tricameral mind (MIND, RECORD, VOICE).

This submodule supports WORK and the Record by documenting how Grace-Mar can support the companion's physical health and fitness, within the system's design: the companion leads; the Voice reflects and responds when queried.

## Purpose

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Companion support** | Activities, prompts, and habits that support the human's health and fitness — sleep, movement, nutrition, recovery. |
| **Record alignment** | When the companion documents preferences, access needs, or health-related observations, the Record can inform how the Voice responds (e.g., encouraging movement, respecting rest). |

The companion is sovereign. skill-work-health-fitness does not prescribe; it offers structure and prompts that the companion can adopt, adapt, or ignore.

## Principles

1. **Meet the companion where they are** — No pushing through resistance. If the companion deflects or shows resistance, respect the boundary. (AGENTS rule 7.)
2. **Companion-led** — Health and fitness goals, pacing, and activities are set by the companion. The system supports; it does not compel.
3. **Evidence-based** — When the Voice offers suggestions, base them on documented Record content (e.g., IX-B curiosity, preferences) or on safe, general principles. Calibrated abstention when outside knowledge.
4. **Integrate with existing flows** — Health/fitness can be woven into lesson prompts, wisdom questions, or checkpoint reflections when the companion consents.
