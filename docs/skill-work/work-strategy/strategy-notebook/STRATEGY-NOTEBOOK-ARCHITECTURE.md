# Strategy notebook — architecture

**Project:** Operator strategy notebook (grace-mar work-strategy)

## Thesis

A **cumulative, dated record** of how the operator reads signals, weighs analogies, and steers frameworks (Islamabad, Rome, briefs, STRATEGY) — distinct from [work-strategy-history.md](../work-strategy-history.md) (lane events) and from [STRATEGY.md](../STRATEGY.md) (milestone ledger).

### Primary output (work-strategy)

The **strategy-notebook** (`chapters/YYYY-MM/days.md` + `meta.md`) is the **primary work output** of the work-strategy lane: dated judgment, synthesis, and links. **Inputs** that feed it — daily briefs, transcript digests, sessions, weak-signal notes, framework drafts — are **not** substitutes for the notebook; they inform the daily block.

[STRATEGY.md](../STRATEGY.md) is a **durable ledger** (watches, analogy list, operator log). **Promotion** into STRATEGY when an arc stabilizes is optional; it does **not** replace writing the notebook block.

## Book promise

- **Daily:** Append one block under the active month in `chapters/YYYY-MM/days.md` using the template below (or add `YYYY-MM-DD.md` per day if you prefer one file per day).
- **Monthly:** Maintain `chapters/YYYY-MM/meta.md` — theme, open questions, optional **bets/watches** lines that may link to STRATEGY §II-A.
- **Optional later:** A small claims list or JSONL if you want machine query; start in markdown only.

## Audience

- **Primary:** the operator (continuity, compression, honest doubt).
- **Secondary:** future you or collaborator stitching months into STRATEGY §IV or public copy.

## Parallel to Predictive History (work-jiang)

| PH | This notebook |
|----|----------------|
| `BOOK-ARCHITECTURE.md` | This file |
| `STATUS.md` | [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) |
| Chapter = lecture unit | **Chapter = calendar month** (`chapters/YYYY-MM/`) |
| `outline.md` / `draft.md` | `meta.md` (month) + `days.md` (daily append) |
| Prediction registry | Optional **Bets / watches** in `meta.md` or month-end box in `days.md` |
| Corpus + adjudication | Links to briefs, `STRATEGY.md`, Islamabad paths — **WORK only** |

## Daily entry template

Paste under `## YYYY-MM-DD` in `days.md` (newest at bottom).

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD

### Signal
- What moved (brief, news, gate, session) — short.

### Judgment
- What you think it implies for strategy (not KY-4 tactics unless you choose).

### Analogy / tension
- Optional. Flag if needs [analogy-audit](../analogy-audit-template.md) before reuse in public copy.

### Links
- e.g. `daily-brief-YYYY-MM-DD.md`, [STRATEGY.md](../STRATEGY.md) §…, framework path.

### Jiang resonance (optional)
- One line: lecture id or “none.”

### Open
- One line carrying to tomorrow.

### Bets / watches (optional)
- 1–3 bullets testable against STRATEGY §II-A or future review.
```

## Daily length and prose (operator target)

- **Target ceiling:** **~2000 words** per dated block in `days.md` (all sections of that day combined: Signal through Bets). Use this as the working **maximum** for routine practice.
- **If draft analysis exceeds ~2000 words:** **Compress** before committing — collapse duplicate points, move long quotation or raw detail to a linked brief/transcript/memo, keep the notebook entry to **synthesis, warrants, and links**.
- **Register:** **Academic prose** — explicit theses, defined terms where needed, qualified claims when evidence is partial; avoid filler and conversational throat-clearing unless you are deliberately archiving tone in a linked artifact.

## Daily synthesis (briefs, transcripts, other work-strategy)

Synthesis **compresses and routes** sources into the notebook; it does **not** duplicate the full daily brief or full transcript.

**Division of labor** (same section headings as above):

| Section | Role |
|---------|------|
| **Signal** | Cross-source bullets (brief + transcript + session): agreement, tension, or explicitly **nothing crossed the strategy threshold today**. |
| **Judgment** | Cross-cutting inference only — **not** a second brief recap. |
| **Links** | Paths to that day’s brief file (if any), transcript digest, framework docs, [STRATEGY.md](../STRATEGY.md) section when relevant. |
| **Open / Bets** | Falsifiable lines and promotion candidates; optional. |

**Optional tag pass (mental shorthand, not schema):** `watch`, `analogy`, `framework`, `defer` — operator labels only; not machine-enforced.

**Light patterns:** convergence vs divergence across sources; assumptions / ledger; spoiler map; trigger [analogy-audit](../analogy-audit-template.md) if the **same** parallel appears in multiple sources; an **empty** Signal (“no strategic threshold today”) is valid.

**Anti-patterns:** triple narrative (brief + transcript + notebook each a full summary); treating STRATEGY.md as a **diary** (update it only on promotion, not every notebook refinement); citing hot numbers from transcripts in Judgment without a **verify** tier when those numbers may ship publicly.

**STRATEGY cadence:** Notebook entries can be daily; **STRATEGY.md** updates when stable (weekly or arc-close), aligned with [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) “stitch to STRATEGY §IV” when you choose.

## skill-strategy modes and verification passes

[`.cursor/skills/skill-strategy/SKILL.md`](../../../../.cursor/skills/skill-strategy/SKILL.md) defines how agents run a **strategy pass**. **Notebook remains primary**; three ideas belong in this architecture:

**Modes**

- **Default** — append or extend the dated block (`Signal` … `Bets`) from the last committed frontier.
- **+ verify** — when the operator asks for **web**, **wires**, or **fact-check** tier: add a subsection such as **`### Web verification (YYYY-MM-DD)`** with **claim → source URL → correction if needed**; put secondary URLs in **`### Links`**. Hot numbers (casualties, ship counts, **oil**) need a **date** or they should not ship to public copy.
- **Promote** — only when the operator asks: **STRATEGY.md** watches / §IV log; not every volatile news day.

**Flashpoint / gap-rank pattern** (Iran–U.S. and similar)

- Short chain: **claim → wire check → operative move** (what to draft, what to defer).
- When using a **ranked gap matrix** (e.g. [us-iran-bargaining-gaps-matrix.md](../us-iran-bargaining-gaps-matrix.md)), **link** it in **Links** so notebook judgment stays tied to the operator file.

**Jiang / PH** — optional **`### Jiang resonance`**: if no lecture applies, one honest **deferred** line beats empty filler. Headlines are not ingested PH thesis.

#### Cross-artifact alignment (planes and layers)

- [Transcript digest planes](../transcript-analysis-haiphong-ritter-johnson-iran-2026-04.md) (**A** negotiation scope · **B** material / Hormuz · **C** narrative) and [work-strategy-rome notes](../work-strategy-rome/notes/2026-04-03-modern-rome-papacy-thesis-stub.md) (**two layers — do not collapse**) share one habit: **document coupling** between registers, do not **merge planes in one sentence** without tagging (same discipline as **dual-register** Lebanon lines in `days.md`).
- [Template three lenses](../../work-politics/analytical-lenses/template-three-lenses.md) maps **S/O/I** lenses to **A/B/C** and adds **Verify tier** + **(W)/(A)/(R)** margin legend — reuse when stitching notebook judgment to campaign or triangulation stubs.

## Accumulation and evolution

**Persistent frontier:** The notebook is **checkpointed state**: `days.md` (and `meta.md` when the month’s story shifts) holds the **running edge** of judgment. Each **`strategy`** pass—see [`.cursor/skills/skill-strategy/SKILL.md`](../../../../.cursor/skills/skill-strategy/SKILL.md)—**reads** that edge and **writes** the next block so the following pass starts from **git**, not chat memory. Informal CS analogy: **memoized** strategy state—the frontier updates **deterministically** from the last committed block.

**Daily chain**

- **`### Open`** is the explicit wire to the **next** day: unresolved questions, deferred analogy audits, “check wire on X.” The next day’s **`### Signal`** should **pick up** at least one Open line while it is still live, or **close** it (“Open from YYYY-MM-DD: resolved because …”).
- **`### Links`** is the **back-pointer**: briefs, transcripts, frameworks, and optional anchors to earlier `days.md` blocks (“continues 2026-04-08 Judgment”) so threads stay traceable without rewriting history.

**Month-level state**

- **`meta.md`** holds slow-moving logic: **Theme**, **Open questions** spanning weeks, **Bets / watches** for month-end review, optional **Polyphony / lens tension** (see below). Touch `meta.md` when the **month’s story** shifts, not necessarily every day.

**Polyphony / lens tension (optional `meta.md` section)**

Wire **cognitive polyphony** at month scale without flattening voices:

- **`## Polyphony / lens tension (month)`** — three short sublines (or bullets), each in the **spirit** of that mind’s fingerprint (see `strategy-notebook/minds/CIV-MIND-*.md`), not generic labels:
  - **Mercouris:** legitimacy, institutional continuity, narrative/diplomatic frame — *what structure makes this event intelligible?*
  - **Mearsheimer:** power distribution, incentives, security competition — *what structural forces make outcomes likely?*
  - **Barnes (optional):** liability, mechanism, who pays / who’s exposed — *what’s binding in budgets, law, and domestic price?*
- **Tension line (one sentence):** Where the Mercouris and Mearsheimer readings **disagree by design** this month — leave unresolved unless a `strategy` pass **promotes** a settled watch to STRATEGY.md.
- **Update cadence:** When the month’s arc shifts (ceasefire scope, Hormuz metrics, Islamabad round) or after a **tri-frame** / heavy lens week — not necessarily every day.
- **[STATUS.md](STATUS.md):** operator-maintained pointer to the **last daily entry** for quick re-entry.

**Month boundaries**

- Optional: one short paragraph when the month turns (new `meta.md` or first day in `days.md`): what carried forward, what closed, what (if anything) promoted to STRATEGY.md.

**Durable vs narrative**

- **Notebook** = chronological narrative and judgment (tension across days may remain visible).
- **STRATEGY.md** = stabilized watches and log lines when you **promote** — not every refinement from every day.

**Named threads (optional convention)**

- Reuse a **short bold label** for a recurring arc (**Islamabad scope**) so search across `days.md` reconstructs the arc.

**Anti-wiring:** If it matters tomorrow, put a line in **Open** or **meta** Open questions — do not rely on chat memory alone.

## Boundaries

- **Not** Voice knowledge, **not** SELF — promote only via RECURSION-GATE if something should enter Record.
- CMC `MEM–*` shards live in civilization_memory; this notebook may **cite** paths, not duplicate corpus authority.
