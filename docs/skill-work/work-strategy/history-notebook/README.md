# History Notebook

**Discoverability:** Linked from **`users/grace-mar/SELF-LIBRARY/history-notebook`** (repo-relative symlink when created). **LIB:** [LIB-0156](../../../../users/grace-mar/self-library.md#operator-analytical-books) (operator-authored chapters) · [LIB-0158 — Bookshelf](../../../../users/grace-mar/self-library.md#bookshelf) (owned print `HNSRC-*` — [BOOKSHELF.md](research/BOOKSHELF.md) vs [operator books](../../../../users/grace-mar/self-library.md#operator-analytical-books)) in [`self-library.md`](../../../../users/grace-mar/self-library.md).

**Operator-authored compressed chapters** distilling civilizational patterns into strategy-ready reference. Five temporal volumes; **target 20 chapters per volume (100 main-era chapters)**; each chapter ~500–1000 words. Not a mirror of CIV-MEM — an independent analytical layer the operator writes and the agent reads.

### Model (chapter-first)

Book identity and chapter IDs remain **SSOT** in [book-architecture.yaml](book-architecture.yaml) and PH wiring in [cross-book-map.yaml](cross-book-map.yaml). History notebook uses a **traditional chapter model** with deliberate variation: **problem-led Volume I** (comparative ancient evidence), five temporal volumes, [STYLE-GUIDE.md](STYLE-GUIDE.md) prose targets, and optional **civilization threads** as longitudinal scratchpads — **not** a separate `hn-knot` file layer. (Strategy-notebook **daily knot** pages, LIB-0153, are unrelated.)

| Piece | Location | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| **Chapters** | [chapters/](chapters/) + YAML ids | Primary deliverable: comparative chapters (~500–1000w); cite **chapter ids** (`hn-i-v1-04`, …) from strategy-notebook **`### History resonance`** |
| **Distillation queue** | [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) | **Single SSOT** for next `hn-*` to draft; strategy **`meta.md`** links here — see [STRATEGY-NOTEBOOK-ARCHITECTURE § Parallel to History notebook](../strategy-notebook/STRATEGY-NOTEBOOK-ARCHITECTURE.md#parallel-to-history-notebook-lib-0156) |
| **Bookshelf** (bibliography) | [research/BOOKSHELF.md](research/BOOKSHELF.md) | **Enhanced bib** for owned print — not full text; distinct from operator-authored [books in self-library](../../../../users/grace-mar/self-library.md#operator-analytical-books) |
| **Bookshelf catalog** (optional) | [research/bookshelf-catalog.yaml](research/bookshelf-catalog.yaml) + [research/BOOKSHELF-RUNBOOK.md](research/BOOKSHELF-RUNBOOK.md) | Machine-readable `HNSRC-*` rows for Bookshelf; **informs** drafting; not chapter SSOT. Run `python3 scripts/validate_bookshelf_catalog.py` after edits. |
| **Vol I library scaffold** (optional) | [research/VOL-I-LIBRARY-SCAFFOLD.md](research/VOL-I-LIBRARY-SCAFFOLD.md) | Maps **HNSRC-*** rows to `hn-i-v1-01`…`20` for problem-spine drafting; see also [VOL-I-PROBLEM-CHAPTERS.md](research/VOL-I-PROBLEM-CHAPTERS.md). |
| **Civilization threads** (optional) | [threads/](threads/) — `history-civ-*.md` | Longitudinal lanes: continuity, mechanism candidates, candidate chapter targets — **scaffolding** for drafting, not a parallel codex |

Flow: **CIV-MEM (reservoir) → distill into HN chapters (`hn-*`) → strategy-notebook** cites ids + mechanisms in **`### History resonance`** (tiers + optional **`HN gap:`** back-pressure — [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)). Threads optional before drafting. Retired experiment: see [knots/README.md](knots/README.md).

- **Chapter format:** See [STYLE-GUIDE.md](STYLE-GUIDE.md)
- **Polyphonic drafting (operator):** [POLYPHONY-WORKFLOW.md](POLYPHONY-WORKFLOW.md) — CIV-MIND passes on a neutral spine, then public translation (no mind names in chapter prose)
- **Architecture SSOT:** [book-architecture.yaml](book-architecture.yaml) — all chapters, volumes, sub-groups, arcs
- **PH wiring SSOT:** [cross-book-map.yaml](cross-book-map.yaml) — sole source of truth for Predictive History ↔ History Notebook links
- **Growth model:** One volume at a time — design → write → validate
- **Strategy notebook (fast judgment):** [../strategy-notebook/README.md](../strategy-notebook/README.md) — daily **`### History resonance`** cites HN **chapter ids** and mechanism lines; see [STRATEGY-NOTEBOOK-ARCHITECTURE § Parallel to History notebook](../strategy-notebook/STRATEGY-NOTEBOOK-ARCHITECTURE.md#parallel-to-history-notebook-lib-0156). Do not duplicate full chapters in `days.md`.

## Civilization arcs

Civilizations that span multiple volumes. The arc registry lives in `book-architecture.yaml`; chapters in each arc connect with cross-volume bridge prose (see [STYLE-GUIDE.md](STYLE-GUIDE.md#cross-volume-bridges-style-convention)).

**Phase 1 thread files** (operator roster): eight longitudinal surfaces in [threads/](threads/) — `history-civ-persia`, `russia`, `china`, `rome`, `islam`, `america`, `germania`, `india`. **Folds:** Francia and France are folded into the **Rome** thread; **Anglia** is folded into the **America** thread (no standalone `history-civ-anglia`).

| Arc | Chapters | Thread |
|-----|----------|--------|
| **Persian** | Vol I (`hn-i-v1-19`) → II → V | [history-civ-persia.md](threads/history-civ-persia.md) — tolerance → compression → siege governance. |
| **Roman / Latin West** | Vol I (`hn-i-v1-04`, `hn-i-v1-05`) → II | [history-civ-rome.md](threads/history-civ-rome.md) — administration and expansion; **Francia and France** live in this lane where analytically relevant. |
| **Islamic** | Vol II (`hn-ii-islam`) and related | [history-civ-islam.md](threads/history-civ-islam.md) — civilizational-religious continuity. |
| **Indian** | Comparative Vol I (e.g. `hn-i-v1-12`, `hn-i-v1-16`, `hn-i-v1-18`) | [history-civ-india.md](threads/history-civ-india.md) — plural incorporation and civilizational depth. |
| **Chinese** | Vol I (`hn-i-v1-16` … `hn-i-v1-18`) → II → V | [history-civ-china.md](threads/history-civ-china.md) — cyclical reunification → bureaucratic maturity → patience as strategy. |
| **Russian** | III → IV → V | [history-civ-russia.md](threads/history-civ-russia.md) — marginal resilience → rupture-regeneration → temporal compression. |
| **Germania** | IV (`hn-iv-germany`) and adjacent | [history-civ-germania.md](threads/history-civ-germania.md) — continental strategic continuity. |
| **American / Anglian** | III (`hn-iii-anglia`) → IV → V | [history-civ-america.md](threads/history-civ-america.md) — constitutional republic → industrial hegemon → overextension; **Anglia** (maritime hegemony → managed decline) folded here. |

## PH wiring — "addresses all of Jiang's theories"

`cross-book-map.yaml` maps all 8 PH theses and 20 concepts to HN chapters. Validate coverage with:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_cross_book.py
```

### Volume wiring checklist

When starting a new volume:

1. **Pre-map** — Open `cross-book-map.yaml` and assign the volume's chapters to the theses and concepts they will address. Set `coverage: partial` (or leave `stub` for concepts the volume doesn't touch).
2. **Write** — Draft chapters per [STYLE-GUIDE.md](STYLE-GUIDE.md). Formation dimensions are natural anchors for PH concepts: education-narrative → education, religious-legitimacy → religion, financialization-empire → economics.
3. **Validate** — Run `validate_cross_book.py`. Review coverage gaps and orphan chapters.
4. **Update** — Promote coverage values in `cross-book-map.yaml` as chapters are completed. Update chapter `status` in `book-architecture.yaml`.

One file to edit for wiring: `cross-book-map.yaml`. No changes to PH metadata; no operator-facing fields in chapter prose.

## Conventions

- **Operator-authored**, not auto-generated — the value is in the compression and judgment
- **Independent growth** — adding a chapter does not require updating CIV-MEM; CIV-MEM growth does not require updating chapters (though it may prompt revision)
- **Inline pattern tags** (`[pattern:X]`) enable future script extraction of an axiom deck without building one now
- **WORK only** — not Record, not Voice knowledge unless gated
- **Public / operator boundary** — chapter prose is public; metadata lives in YAML only (see [STYLE-GUIDE.md](STYLE-GUIDE.md))
