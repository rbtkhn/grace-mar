# Skill-work

**Grace-Mar instance · Parent for work-related submodules (cloned from companion-self template)**

This folder holds **submodules** that support WORK, the Record, and instances: reference material (Alpha School), and related content. Cloned from [companion-self docs/skill-work](https://github.com/rbtkhn/companion-self/tree/main/docs/skill-work). Each submodule has its own README.

## Submodules

| Submodule / doc | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| **[skill-work-alpha-school](skill-work-alpha-school/)** | Tool for **Alpha School families**: benchmarks (YAML), 2-hour screen-time target, Record-driven prompts. Optional comparison targets. |
| **[skill-work-companion-self](skill-work-companion-self/)** | **Objective:** Eventually enable Grace-Mar to autonomously manage/improve the companion-self codebase and maintain proper sync between companion-self and grace-mar. Phased: read/audit → suggest → stage PRs + sync → autonomous within bounds. See [roadmap](skill-work-companion-self/roadmap.md). |
| **[skill-work-curate-library](skill-work-curate-library/)** | **Objective:** Curate and maintain Grace-Mar's self-library — curated lookup sources (books, videos, reference works). Gated; feeds LIBRARY_LOOKUP_PROMPT and curriculum export. |
| **[skill-work-grace-gems](skill-work-grace-gems/)** | **Objective:** Manage the Grace Gems Etsy business ([etsy.com/market/grace_gems](https://www.etsy.com/market/grace_gems)) — custom fine jewelry with natural gemstones. Record context; operator flows; optional lesson/WORK integration. See [roadmap](skill-work-grace-gems/roadmap.md). |
| **[skill-work-health-fitness](skill-work-health-fitness/)** | **Objective:** Optimize health and fitness of Grace-Mar's human companion. Companion-led; meet where they are; integrate with existing flows (lesson prompts, wisdom questions). |
| **[skill-work-human-teacher](skill-work-human-teacher/)** | **Objective:** Personalized education for the companion — human-teacher pattern (read skill-think, modulate focus and gate, respect identity). Record-derived prompts; recursion with alpha-school. See [roadmap](skill-work-human-teacher/roadmap.md). |
| **[skill-work-lesson-generation-walkthrough](skill-work-lesson-generation-walkthrough.md)** | Tool for **Grace-Mar's human companion**: personalized lesson prompts from Record. How skill-work (with THINK, SELF) generates prompts — flow, minimal prompt shape, and four concrete examples (reading, math, WORK, integrated block). |
| **[sample-lesson-prompt-grace-mar.txt](sample-lesson-prompt-grace-mar.txt)** | **Demo:** One-prompt-per-day lesson generated from the current grace-mar Record. Copy the content (below the line) into ChatGPT or Grok to run 3–5 activities in one thread. Regenerate when the Record changes. |
