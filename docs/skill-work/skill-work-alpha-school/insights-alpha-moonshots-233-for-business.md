# Insights for Business Plan and White Paper (Alpha / Moonshots #233)

**Companion-Self template · Source:** *Moonshots #233 — This $40M AI Company Is Using AI Tutors to Teach 2 Hours/Day* (Alpha Schools: McKenzie Price, Joe Lamont). Use these in instance business plan, white paper, and GTM narrative. This doc stays in the template; instances (e.g. grace-mar) may copy or adapt. Cloned into grace-mar.

## 1. White paper & positioning

- **Demand:** "We've known for 40 years how kids could learn 2–10x faster. It doesn't work in a teacher-in-front-of-classroom model." Use to reinforce that the *model* (personalized, mastery-based, tech-enabled) is validated; Grace-Mar is the *identity layer* that model lacks.
- **Proof of demand:** "1,000 people at New York's Alpha info session"; "once Alpha has 100 people, everybody wants to come; nobody wants to be the first 20." Supports category validation and "founding family" / first-mover angle.
- **What Alpha doesn't provide:** Add **narrative/transcript** — Alpha has placement and engagement; Grace-Mar has first-person narrative, "we did X," journal, artifact trail. "Your schools have been lying to you… A student could be one year ahead or three years behind" → Record makes actual state explicit and portable.
- **Knowledge boundary as trust:** "Chat bots are cheat bots"; Alpha disables chat in the morning to "fill kids with ideas." Grace-Mar's knowledge boundary (no LLM inference into Record) aligns with serious learning design and is a trust/compliance story.
- **Supplemental:** "If you're not willing to rebuild around kids must love school, this isn't going to work." Alpha's moat is culture; Grace-Mar is the portable identity layer that can feed any tutor/school.

## 2. Business plan & GTM

- **Market:** "Private school market's a $50 billion market." TAM for identity layer is a slice of that plus the larger non-$40K segment (homeschool, Khan/IXL, microschools).
- **Scaling:** "Schools don't scale because you're limited by teachers." Alpha's fix: AI teaches, guides motivate. Grace-Mar's: identity scales via pipeline + gate + export; no teacher bottleneck.
- **Parent belief:** "The single biggest impediment is what our parents believe." GTM through parent education, content, referrals; "see a kid with a Record do something yours can't."
- **Sequencing:** "10 charters applied, 10 rejected." Reinforces private/homeschool/microschool first; proof before platform.
- **Proof:** "Million-student RCT… pharmaceutical-grade… so everybody can say this isn't a hoax." Grace-Mar's proof architecture (pipeline health, gate integrity, retention, evidence quality) is the identity-layer analogue.

## 3. Prospectus & differentiation

- **Problem one-liner:** "Half of seniors graduate knowing as much math as a 99th percentile third grader." Identity/Record makes actual state visible.
- **Trust:** "We want to fill kids with ideas." Knowledge boundary = fill the Record with user-approved, artifact-backed content only.
- **Wedge:** "We don't build incentive systems; we build the Record that incentive systems and tutors consume." "We did X" = lightweight ritual; Record = engagement substrate.
- **Risk:** "How do you motivate when you don't own the school day?" Grace-Mar: we own the identity layer; motivation comes from parent/operator/ritual.

## 4. Tying insights to skill-think, skill-write, and skill-work

The Record's three capability containers — **THINK**, **WRITE**, **WORK** (self-skill-think, self-skill-write, self-skill-work) — map cleanly to Alpha's model and to business/product narrative. Use these ties in white paper, sales, and integration storytelling.

### Skill-read (intake, comprehension, what they consume)

| Alpha / Moonshots #233 | Companion-Self / Record tie |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 2-hour core block is largely **academic intake**: personalized lessons, "at their level," zone of proximal development. | **READ** = what the companion has consumed and understood. Evidence: reading list, media log, comprehension signals. Edge = what they're ready to read/watch next. |
| "Knowledge graph… what do they know and not know? Interest graph." | **READ** evidence + IX-A (knowledge) + IX-B (curiosity) form the **interest and knowledge** layer. Export for tutors: "what they've read, what they're curious about, where they're at." |
| "Dual coding — visual and auditory at once." | **READ** is multimodal (text, video, audio, images). Record and export should tag modality; curriculum/tutor can match. |
| "Don't have chat in the morning… we want to fill kids with ideas." | **READ** is the *intake* side of "fill with ideas." Record holds what they actually consumed and approved; no LLM fill. |
| Vision models "watching the screen" for focused vs guessing. | **READ** evidence quality: was this focused learning or skim/guess? Instance can track READ behavior (e.g. time on task, artifact linkage) as proof/quality signal. |

**Business/white paper line:** "Skill-read is the **consumption and comprehension** layer. We record what they read, watch, and understand — at their level and interest — so any tutor or platform can pick up at the right edge."

---

### Skill-write (production, expression, their voice)

| Alpha / Moonshots #233 | Companion-Self / Record tie |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Alpha Write, journal, stories, explanations; "linguistic fingerprint." | **WRITE** = what the companion produces: journal, stories, explanations, messages. Evidence: writing log, samples; self-skill-write = vocabulary, complexity, style, voice. |
| "You're not going to see a guide showing a kid how to carry the one… they're helping kids develop learning how to learn: Did you read the explanation?" | **WRITE** is also the *output* of learning: explain back, teach Grace-Mar (e.g. "Explain what you learned"). Evidence of WRITE = evidence of understanding. |
| "Fill kids with ideas" vs "chat steals that away." | **WRITE** in the Record = *their* ideas and words, not the model's. Record is the place their voice and expression live; Voice speaks it. |
| Mastery-based: "you don't move up until you master." | **WRITE** capability claims (level, dimensions) advance only with approved evidence — no grade inflation; artifact-linked. |
| "Evidence-grounding = confidence-grounding… you wrote this, you drew this." | **WRITE** (and WORK) artifacts are the primary evidence. Business story: "We don't infer; we record what they actually wrote and made." |

**Business/white paper line:** "Skill-write is the **expression and voice** layer. We record what they write and say — in their words — so the Record is their documented voice, not a platform's summary."

---

### Skill-build (making, planning, execution, creation)

| Alpha / Moonshots #233 | Companion-Self / Record tie |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Afternoon = **life skills workshops**: entrepreneurship, rock band, food trucks, Broadway, sailing, "four years working on a passion project." | **WORK** = what they make, plan, and execute. Evidence: creation log, projects, artifacts; self-skill-work = planning, execution, originality, collaboration. |
| "Creators and contributors, not consumers." | **WORK** (and WRITE) = creation; READ = consumption. Record shows the balance: what they take in (READ) vs what they make (WRITE, WORK). |
| "Fifth graders running food trucks and Airbnbs"; "senior putting on a Broadway musical… source singers off TikTok, music rights, fill a venue." | **WORK** evidence is real projects with real outcomes — not simulated. Export can surface "what they've built" for admissions, portfolios, tutors. |
| "Guides connect kids with experts… learn how to become an expert in that field." | **WORK** growth often depends on mentorship and resources. Record can reference "who helped, what was built"; integration story = "Record + expert network." |
| "Grit," "Rubik's cube as proxy for grit." | **WORK** dimensions (persistence, execution, flexibility) map to life skills. Business: "We don't teach grit; we **record** it through WORK evidence." |

**Business/white paper line:** "Skill-build is the **making and doing** layer. We record what they build, plan, and ship — passion projects, ventures, creations — so the Record is a portfolio of demonstrated capability, not self-report."

### One-table summary (for slides or appendix)

| Skill | Alpha analogue | Record / export value for business |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| **READ** | 2-hour core block, knowledge/interest graph, "fill with ideas," dual coding | Intake and comprehension at their level; reading/listening edge; interest + knowledge for tutor personalization. |
| **WRITE** | Alpha Write, journal, explanations, "their voice," no chat to cheat | Their words and voice in one place; evidence of understanding; portable writing portfolio. |
| **WORK** | Afternoon workshops, passion projects, entrepreneurship, "creators not consumers" | What they've made and done; life skills as evidence; portfolio for admissions/employers. |
