# Grace-Mar Pilot One-Sheet

*Version 1.0 · February 2026 · Audience: Strategic Education Operators*

## Pilot Objective

Validate that Grace-Mar improves learner-context continuity and trust operations in real instructional workflows without requiring platform replacement.

## Pilot Structure

- **Duration:** 8-12 weeks
- **Model:** Paid, scoped pilot with a single operator partner
- **Scope:** One defined learner segment and one bounded workflow
- **Cadence:** Weekly operating review + biweekly executive checkpoint
- **Output:** Joint pilot report with outcomes, lessons, and go/no-go recommendation

## What Grace-Mar Delivers

- Portable, evidence-linked learner Record (`SELF`, `SKILLS`, `EVIDENCE`)
- Governance control: agent stages updates; user approves merges
- Workflow support for artifact capture, candidate staging, and review
- Export surfaces for downstream agent/platform use
- Pilot reporting pack for operational and trust metrics

## Integration Boundary (Pilot-Safe)

- **No core system replacement:** existing LMS/tutoring workflows remain in place
- **Limited data surface:** only pilot-designated learner artifacts and metadata
- **Controlled write path:** no autonomous merge; user approval required for durable profile changes
- **Auditability:** event trail for staged, approved, rejected, and applied candidates

## Success Metrics (Joint Scorecard)

- **Continuity quality:** percentage of profile claims linked to evidence
- **Workflow speed:** median time from artifact capture to approved profile update
- **Queue health:** review completion rate and queue age
- **Trust quality:** parent/guardian confidence signal on profile accuracy and control
- **Engagement depth:** repeated usage of Record/Voice workflows across pilot weeks

## Partner Commitments

- Appoint one program owner and one technical point of contact
- Define pilot learner segment and target workflow at kickoff
- Participate in weekly review and biweekly checkpoint
- Provide structured feedback on usability, trust, and operational fit
- Support publication of anonymized pilot outcomes (if mutually approved)

## Grace-Mar Commitments

- Configure pilot environment and operator workflow templates
- Deliver onboarding for staff and participating families
- Run weekly health reporting and issue triage
- Maintain governance controls and data handling boundaries
- Provide end-of-pilot results package and scale recommendation

## Decision Criteria at Pilot End

- **Scale:** metrics meet thresholds and operator confirms workflow fit
- **Extend:** partial success with clear remediation plan
- **Stop:** insufficient operational lift or trust outcomes

## Commercial Terms (Template Range)

- **Pilot fee:** scoped fixed fee based on segment size and integration complexity
- **Post-pilot path:** operator tier subscription and/or expanded deployment SOW
- **Exclusions:** broad custom feature development outside pilot scope

## Next Step

Schedule a 45-minute pilot scoping call to finalize segment, workflow boundary, scorecard thresholds, and implementation timeline.
