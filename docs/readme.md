# Grace-Mar — Document Map

**Where to go for what.** This folder holds the protocol, governance, and commentary. Use the table below to find the right document.

| Need | Document | Role |
|------|----------|------|
| **Protocol (the compact)** | [IDENTITY-FORK-PROTOCOL](identity-fork-protocol.md) | Canonical spec: schema, staging contract, evidence, export. Mechanism only. |
| **Governance** | [GRACE-MAR-CORE](grace-mar-core.md) | Global governance, prime directive, invariants. |
| **Interpretation & intent** | [CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK](conceptual-framework.md), [DESIGN-NOTES](design-notes.md) | Why we built it this way; design principles; objections answered. Federalist-style commentary. |
| **Narrative & differentiation** | [WHITE-PAPER](white-paper.md) | Full story, positioning, technical model. |
| **Business** | [BUSINESS-PLAN](business-plan.md), [BUSINESS-PROSPECTUS](business-prospectus.md), [BUSINESS-ROADMAP](business-roadmap.md) | Operating plan, market, revenue, roadmap. |
| **Implementation** | [AGENTS](../agents.md), [ARCHITECTURE](architecture.md) | Guardrails for AI and developers; system design. |
| **Intent schema** | [INTENT-TEMPLATE](intent-template.md) | Machine-readable goal hierarchy, trade-offs, and escalation rules. |
| **Session/development handoff** | [DEVELOPMENT-HANDOFF](development-handoff.md) | Latest engineering state and restart checklist for new agent conversations. |
| **Operator / pilot onboarding** | [OPERATOR-BRIEF](operator-brief.md), [LETTER-TO-USER](letter-to-user.md), [LETTER-TO-STUDENT](letter-to-student.md) | Age-neutral operator brief; letters to the companion (age-neutral and school-aged variants). [PARENT-BRIEF](parent-brief.md) = parent/guardian variant. |
| **Using Grace-Mar without a school** | [USING-GRACE-MAR-WITHOUT-A-SCHOOL](using-grace-mar-without-a-school.md) | Homeschool / standalone: who it's for, core loop, "we did X" + /review, export, optional stack (e.g. Grace-Mar + Khan/IXL). |
| **Audits** | [audit-companion-self](audit-companion-self.md), [AUDIT-GRACE-MAR-VS-COMPANION-SELF-TEMPLATE](audit-grace-mar-vs-companion-self-template.md) | Companion-self concept alignment; instance vs template (structure, protocol, schema). |

**Hierarchy:** The protocol (IDENTITY-FORK-PROTOCOL) is the thing to implement. CORE is governance. CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK and DESIGN-NOTES interpret and explain intent. WHITE-PAPER and prospectus are narrative and business.

**Objections answered:** See [DESIGN-NOTES §17](design-notes.md#17-objections-and-answers).
