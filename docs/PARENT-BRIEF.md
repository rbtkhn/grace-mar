# Parent Brief — Grace-Mar Pilot

For the parent/guardian of the pilot student.

## What is Grace-Mar?

A **cognitive emulator** is a system your child teaches. Unlike typical apps that teach kids, this one learns *from* them. Over time it becomes a **cognitive fork** — a versioned record of how they think, what they know, and who they are, growing independently from a snapshot in time.

Your child is the teacher. The system only grows through their activity.

## First Session: Seed Survey

The first session is a short survey to get to know your child. Four questions:

1. What are your favorite movies or shows?
2. What are your favorite books or stories?
3. What are your favorite places?
4. What are your favorite games?

**Duration:** ~10–15 minutes (adjust for attention span)

**Who should be present:** Parent + child. The child answers; the parent can help prompt, rephrase, or type if needed.

## How We Capture Responses

- **Typing:** Parent types while the child answers (recommended for age 6)
- **Voice:** If using voice, responses are transcribed afterward
- **Relaxed:** No wrong answers. Partial or silly answers are fine — they all inform the profile.

---

## Consent

- Parent/guardian consent is required for participation
- Your child may stop at any time
- You may request full deletion of all data at any time
- Milestone re-consent at ages 13, 16, 18 (per GRACE-MAR-CORE)

---

## What Gets Stored

- Survey responses → SELF.preferences (favorites)
- Future sessions → Reading list, writing samples, creations
- Everything is stored in a private GitHub repository; no third-party sharing without explicit permission

## Your Role: Co-Learner, Not Just Supervisor

Position yourself as a **co-learner** with your child. AI evolves quickly; you may not have more expertise than they do. Instead of only supervising, embrace open-minded, transparent conversations. Explore the bot together, ask questions together, and be willing to navigate the space alongside them through trial, error, and adjustments.

## Before the Session

1. Read [LETTER-TO-STUDENT.md](LETTER-TO-STUDENT.md) if you want to frame it for your child
2. Ensure you can type responses in real time (or plan for transcription)
3. Confirm consent (verbal is fine; we log it in SESSION-LOG)
