**Dear [Name],**

I have something really exciting to tell you.

You know how you learn new things every day? Like when you figured out how to count by twos, or when you learned the names of all the planets, or when you discovered your favorite song?

Well, I'm making something special. It's like a learning friend that lives on a tablet. And here's the cool part:

**You get to teach it.**

That's right — *you* are the teacher.

Right now, this learning friend doesn't know anything. It has an empty brain! But every time you teach it something, it remembers. If you teach it about your favorite book, it will remember. If you teach it about your pet, or your family, or what you learned at school — it remembers everything.

And the more you teach it, the smarter it gets.

You can talk to it. You can draw pictures for it. You can tell it stories. Whatever you want to share, it will listen and learn.

**Here's why you're so special:**

You are the very first kid in the whole world to try this.

Nobody else has done this before. You're like an explorer going somewhere new. And I really need your help to make it better.

Some things might not work perfectly at first. That's okay! You can tell me what's fun and what's not fun, what's easy and what's confusing. Your ideas will help me make it great for others too.

**What will happen:**

For the next two months, you'll get to play with your learning friend a few times a week. Maybe after school, or on weekends — whatever time works best for you and your mom/dad.

You can teach it anything you want. There are no wrong answers. There's no test. It's just you and your learning friend, growing smarter together.

**One more thing:**

You get to give your learning friend a name. It can be any name you want. It's yours.

I'm so excited for you to try this. Thank you for being my helper.

Talk soon,

[Your name]

*P.S. — If you ever want to stop, that's totally okay. This is supposed to be fun, not homework!*
