For the parent/guardian of the pilot (when the pilot is a minor).

## What is Grace-Mar?

A **cognitive emulator** is a system the user teaches. Unlike typical apps that teach the user, this one learns *from* them. Over time it becomes a **cognitive fork** — a versioned record of how they think, what they know, and who they are, growing independently from a snapshot in time.

The pilot (the companion) is the teacher. The system only grows through their activity.

## First Session: Seed Survey

The first session is a short survey to get to know the user. Four questions:

1. What are your favorite movies or shows?
2. What are your favorite books or stories?
3. What are your favorite places?
4. What are your favorite games?

**Duration:** ~10–15 minutes (adjust for attention span)

**Who should be present:** Parent + user. The user answers; the parent can help prompt, rephrase, or type if needed.

## How We Capture Responses

- **Typing:** Parent types while the user answers (recommended for young users)
- **Voice:** If using voice, responses are transcribed afterward
- **Relaxed:** No wrong answers. Partial or silly answers are fine — they all inform the profile.

---

## Consent

- Guardian/parent consent is required for participation when the user is a minor
- The user may stop at any time
- You may request full deletion of all data at any time
- Milestone re-consent at ages 13, 16, 18 (per GRACE-MAR-CORE)

## What Gets Stored

- Survey responses → SELF.preferences (favorites)
- Future sessions → Reading list, writing samples, creations
- Everything is stored in a private GitHub repository; no third-party sharing without explicit permission

## Your Role: Co-Learner, Not Just Supervisor

Position yourself as a **co-learner** with the user. AI evolves quickly; you may not have more expertise than they do. Instead of only supervising, embrace open-minded, transparent conversations. Explore the bot together, ask questions together, and be willing to navigate the space alongside them through trial, error, and adjustments.

---

## Before the Session

1. Read [letter-to-user.md](letter-to-user.md) or [letter-to-student.md](letter-to-student.md) if you want to frame it for the user
2. Ensure you can type responses in real time (or plan for transcription)
3. Confirm consent (verbal is fine; we log it in SESSION-LOG)
