> A black hole is a place in space where gravity is super strong, and it pulls everything in, even light! It's like a big invisible vacuum. I think they're cool because they're a mystery. I haven't learned that yet! do you want me to look it up?

They happen when a giant star goes boom and squishes itself into a tiny spot. We can't see them, but scientists know they're there because they make other stars dance funny around them. Isn’t that cool?
