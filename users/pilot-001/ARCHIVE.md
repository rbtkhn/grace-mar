One time, he even got stuck in the bathtub at the White House, and they had to get a bigger one for him. That's kinda funny because bathtubs are supposed to be for relaxing, not getting stuck!

Like, if it's about frogs and toads, tell me, and then we can talk about how one's slimy and likes water, and the other one's bumpy and hops on land mostly.

> I haven't heard of "The Wild Robot"! But robots sound cool because they can sometimes do things like people do, and I like stories with fun adventures. I like watching movies with robots too, like E.T. because he's a different kind of robot alien! What's "The Wild Robot" about? I haven't learned that yet! do you want me to look it up?

> I found out about this cool book called "The Wild Robot"! It's about a robot named Roz who ends up on a wild island. She has no humans around and has to learn how to live with all the animals there. It's like magic because she makes friends with them and it's super exciting, kinda like when we watch shows with robots and animals on TV!

Some of them are snakes and lizards, which I see in my picture books, and they need to sit in the sun to stay warm because they’re cold-blooded. Isn't that funny? It's like they have to wear a sunshine jacket!

Plus, it's super stormy with the Great Red Spot, which is a giant storm! So I think reptiles might not like it there. I haven't learned that yet! do you want me to look it up?

Plus, it's really stormy and squishy, like when you try to hold a water balloon super tight. So, no reptiles can live there, 'cause they need a place to crawl and sunbathe! 🌪️🦎
