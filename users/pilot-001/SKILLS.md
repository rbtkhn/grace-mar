## I. CONTAINER STATUS

### READ Container

```yaml
status: ACTIVE (first Tier 4 evidence: WRITE-0001 as retell)
letters: yes (all 26)
reads_words: yes
reads_sentences: yes
reads_pages: yes
sounds_out_unfamiliar: yes
retells_stories: yes     # CONFIRMED — WRITE-0001 retells Madeline from memory with high accuracy
vocabulary_level: 2
comprehension_level: 3    # UPGRADED — retell captures key elements, characters, sequence, and character traits (bravery)
inference_level: null     # not yet assessed
edge: "Longer independent text; early chapter books; inference questions; retelling with explicit sentence structure"
gaps: []
notes: "WRITE-0001 confirms strong literary recall — ~40 words of Madeline reconstructed from memory with key elements intact (setting, characters, traits, action). Captures meaning not just words — paraphrases verse into prose. Collaborative reading preferred (Phase 2) despite independent capability."
```

### WRITE Container

```yaml
status: ACTIVE (3 samples — WRITE-0001, WRITE-0002, WRITE-0003)
writes_name: yes
writes_words: yes
writes_sentences: yes
writes_multiple_sentences: YES  # CONFIRMED by WRITE-0003 — three distinct sentences with periods
phonetic_spelling: YES     # CONFIRMED (decreasing frequency across samples)
writes_extended_text: yes  # 40-48 word pieces
writes_original: yes       # CONFIRMED by WRITE-0002 + WRITE-0003
uses_periods: YES          # NEW — WRITE-0003 has 3 periods (was absent in 0001/0002)
uses_because: YES          # habitual — 3 uses across 2 samples
uses_past_tense: YES       # "I used to be afraid" — WRITE-0003
uses_future_tense: YES     # "I want to wach" — WRITE-0003
vocabulary_level: 2-3      # academic + personal; "spaghetti" spelled correctly
complexity_level: 3        # UPGRADED — three sentences, three topics, three tenses
style_level: 2-3           # sentence boundaries, "because" habitual, varied openers
expression_level: 2-3      # personal reflection ("I used to be afraid"), opinions, preferences
logic_level: 2-3           # "because" + causal reasoning, past→present→future structure
edge: "Capitals at sentence start (inconsistent); variety of connectors (then, so, but, also); narrative/story writing (fiction); longer compositions"
gaps:
  - "No fiction/narrative writing yet — has retell, informational, and journal"
  - "Capitals at sentence start inconsistent (2/3 in WRITE-0003)"
notes: "Three samples show rapid progression: run-on retell (0001) → run-on original with segments (0002) → sentences with periods (0003). WRITE-0003 is a breakthrough — periods, three tenses (past/present/future), self-reflection. 'Because' is habitual (3 uses). Phonetic errors decreasing. Next: fiction/narrative writing, consistent capitalization."
```

### BUILD Container

```yaml
status: ACTIVE (creation dimensions from CREATE-0001–0008; planning/execution from ACT-0035 BUILD probe)
# Creation (merged from IMAGINE)
originality_level: 4      # original visual interpretation of text-only Chinese story (CREATE-0001); BUILD probe confirmed story combo (Deer+Madeline)
elaboration_level: 4      # detailed — careful color banding, shading, decorative elements; BUILD probe confirmed (scarf, eyelashes, whole world)
flexibility_level: 3      # works within story framework but makes own visual choices; BUILD probe confirmed (add one thing not in book)
# Planning/execution (evidenced by BUILD probe ACT-0035)
planning_level: 1-2       # can order steps for familiar tasks (drawing: get materials first; lemonade stand: lemonade first)
execution_level: 1        # next step in sequence (Lego: go to step 5 after step 4)
making_level: 1           # follows instructions + looks at box (Legos — methodical)
financial_level: null
collaboration_level: null
decision_making: 1        # can give reason for choice (why pick deer: kind, brave, beautiful)
edge: "Narrative creation from prompts; cross-language creative tasks; independent scene composition; planning/execution evidenced via BUILD probe (step order, next step, making method)"
gaps: []
notes: "Creation: CREATE-0001–0008 show strong creation capability. BUILD probe (2026-02-24, ACT-0035): planning (step order), execution (next step), making (Legos instructions+box), elaboration/flexibility/originality/decision_making confirmed. Human gates all merges."
```

### MATH (contextual — not a module, but tracked)

```yaml
status: SEED (parent-reported, Tier 5)
counts_to: 100
addition: yes (single digit)
subtraction: yes (single digit)
tells_time: no           # EDGE
days_of_week: yes (forward AND backward)
edge: "Telling time; place value; double-digit operations"
notes: "Days of week backward is a strong sequential reasoning signal."
```

### CHINESE (contextual)

```yaml
status: SEED (parent-reported, Tier 5)
oral_conversational: yes  # daily home use, full back-and-forth
counts_in_chinese: yes    # at least to 10
character_recognition: no # EDGE — literacy not started
character_writing: no
edge: "First character recognition; expanding vocabulary beyond home context"
notes: "Strong oral. Literacy is a clear future growth area."
```
