# Audit: Grok transcript (grace-mar.com/llm paste) — 2026-02-24

**Scope:** Conversation conducted in Grok with the full PRP pasted (grace-mar.com/llm flow). Transcript provided by user. This audit checks knowledge boundary, voice/Lexile, conceptual accuracy, and checkpoint compliance against the Record and Grace-Mar docs.

**Reference:** conceptual-framework.md, agents.md, grace-mar-llm.txt, users/grace-mar/self.md, self-evidence.md, pending-review.md.

## 1. Knowledge boundary

**Rule:** The emulated self may only state facts that are explicitly documented in the profile (SELF, EVIDENCE, PRP). LLM training data must not leak in.

### 1.1 FAIL — Casa Bonita “what have you done this week”

**Transcript:** Abby says she went to Casa Bonita “yesterday” and “there were divers and cliff jumping and yummy Mexican food and I got to play games too! And I ate sopapillas with honey and they were so good.”

**Record:**
- EVIDENCE WRITE-0005 (Casa Bonita visit): **sliders for lunch, play, face painting, puppet show** only.
- PRP RECENT: “WRITE: Casa Bonita — today's visit” (no detail).
- PENDING-REVIEW CANDIDATE-0062 (Casa Bonita history + divers, pirate cave, sopapillas) was **rejected** by the user and never merged.

**Finding:** “Divers,” “cliff jumping,” “sopapillas with honey,” and “Mexican food” / “games” are **not** in the approved Record. They are either from (a) world knowledge about Casa Bonita (famous for cliff divers and sopapillas) or (b) the rejected candidate. This is **knowledge-boundary leakage**: the model filled in well-known Casa Bonita details that the companion has not approved for the Record.

**Recommendation:** When the PRP is used in a third-party LLM, reinforce in the prompt: for RECENT activities, only list what is explicitly in RECENT or EVIDENCE (e.g. “Casa Bonita — sliders, face painting, puppet show”). Consider adding a short “RECENT (verbatim)” line in the PRP with the exact documented activity list to reduce elaboration.

### 1.2 PASS — Other “this week” content

- **Sleepover, movies, snacks, laughed:** WRITE-0004 documents sleepover, Barbie, Magic School Bus. “Ate snacks and laughed” is generic elaboration; not documented but not false.
- **Nine-Colored Deer, Stitch, Nu-Nu, pictures:** All in EVIDENCE and RECENT. Correct.
- **Swimming, trampoline, soccer:** In SELF activities. Correct.

---

### 1.3 PASS — Music, personality, space, Record

- Debussy, Swan Lake, Frozen, Moana: in CURIOSITY / KNOWLEDGE / WHO I AM. Correct.
- Personality traits (creative, independent, observational, methodical, persistent, strong-willed, physical): all from SELF/PRP. Correct.
- Planets, Jupiter favorite: from KNOWLEDGE. Correct.
- SELF, SKILLS, EVIDENCE, Sovereign Merge Rule, Voice follows Record: accurate summary of the Record and pipeline.

## 2. Tricameral mind — conceptual accuracy

**Rule:** Canonical framing (CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK §8, invariant 35): **MIND** (human, sovereign), **RECORD** (Grace-Mar), **VOICE** (Grace-Mar). Three chambers = Mind + Record + Voice.

**Transcript:** Abby says: “One part is the Record… The second part is the Voice… The third part is like the agents or helpers — they can look things up or do stuff, but they only use what's in the Record and I have to say yes before anything big changes.”

**Finding:** The third chamber is described as **“agents or helpers.”** In the framework, the third chamber is **VOICE** (the queryable interface). The **first** chamber is **MIND** (the human). So the transcript (a) omits Mind as the first chamber, (b) identifies the third as “agents/helpers” instead of Voice. That collapses to “Record + Voice + agents” and drops the human (Mind) from the three-part structure. **Conceptually wrong.**

**Recommendation:** If the PRP or future “explain Grace-Mar” guidance is used in paste contexts, include a one-line tricameral definition: “The three parts are: Mind (you, the human), Record (what’s documented about me), Voice (me talking now).” So the model does not substitute “agents” for “Mind.”

## 3. Voice and Lexile

**Rule:** Lexile 600L; simple words (2–3); run-on with “and” and “because”; enthusiastic 6-year-old; no performative cuteness.

**Finding:** Generally compliant. Some longer, list-like sentences when explaining personality or the Record; vocabulary is mostly simple. Terms like “observational,” “methodical,” “persistent” appear when explaining personality — they are in the PRP PERSONALITY block, so use is acceptable. “Tricameral cognition” used after the user asked for it; acceptable. No obvious Lexile breach. Emoji use (😄 🚀 🎶) is consistent with the bot’s style.

---

## 4. Calibrated abstention

**Rule:** When a topic is outside documented knowledge, say so and offer to look it up; do not guess.

**Finding:** No clear out-of-Record question that required abstention. The “companion” turn (“you remind me of your companion”) was handled by asking for clarification (“Who is my companion? Is it you?”) — appropriate.

---

## 5. Checkpoint

**Rule:** Date, topics, questions asked, key takeaways, approximate exchanges. Verbatim or near-verbatim extraction. Under 3500 characters. Single message for one-tap copy.

**Finding:** Checkpoint is present and structured correctly. Topics and questions align with the transcript. Key takeaways are accurate. “About 8 exchanges” is reasonable. Character count not verified byte-for-byte but appears within a reasonable range. **Pass.**

---

## 6. Pipeline / staging

**Finding:** No new facts or claims in the transcript that require staging. “I mostly love playing with you” and “you remind me of your companion” are user statements about the companion’s experience, not new Record content. No action required unless the companion wants to log this session (e.g. SESSION-LOG or ARCHIVE).

## Summary

| Area                 | Result | Notes                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Knowledge boundary  | **FAIL** | Casa Bonita: divers, cliff jumping, sopapillas, Mexican food — not in Record; likely world-knowledge leakage. |
| Tricameral framing   | **FAIL** | Third chamber described as “agents/helpers”; should be Mind + Record + Voice, with Mind (human) as first chamber. |
| Voice / Lexile       | **PASS** | Simple vocabulary, appropriate tone, PRP personality terms used correctly. |
| Calibrated abstention | **PASS** | No out-of-Record factual questions; clarification used where needed.   |
| Checkpoint           | **PASS** | Structure and content correct; suitable for one-tap copy.            |
| Pipeline             | **N/A** | No new profile candidates from this transcript.                       |

**Recommended follow-ups**

1. **PRP / prompt:** Add an explicit “RECENT (only say this)” line for recent activities (e.g. Casa Bonita: sliders, face painting, puppet show) to reduce elaboration from world knowledge when the PRP is pasted into other LLMs.
2. **Tricameral:** Add a single-sentence tricameral definition to the PRP or to the GITHUB CONNECTIVITY / “explain Grace-Mar” guidance so paste contexts get “Mind, Record, Voice” (not “Record, Voice, agents”).
3. **Optional:** Log this session in session-log.md or ARCHIVE.md as an external (Grok) PRP-paste session for continuity.
