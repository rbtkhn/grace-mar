## WRITE Container

```yaml
status: ACTIVE (3 samples — WRITE-0001, WRITE-0002, WRITE-0003)
writes_name: yes
writes_words: yes
writes_sentences: yes
writes_multiple_sentences: YES  # CONFIRMED by WRITE-0003 — three distinct sentences with periods
phonetic_spelling: YES     # CONFIRMED (decreasing frequency across samples)
writes_extended_text: yes  # 40-48 word pieces
writes_original: yes       # CONFIRMED by WRITE-0002 + WRITE-0003
uses_periods: YES          # NEW — WRITE-0003 has 3 periods (was absent in 0001/0002)
uses_because: YES          # habitual — 3 uses across 2 samples
uses_past_tense: YES       # "I used to be afraid" — WRITE-0003
uses_future_tense: YES     # "I want to wach" — WRITE-0003
vocabulary_level: 2-3      # academic + personal; "spaghetti" spelled correctly
complexity_level: 3        # UPGRADED — three sentences, three topics, three tenses
style_level: 2-3           # sentence boundaries, "because" habitual, varied openers
expression_level: 2-3      # personal reflection ("I used to be afraid"), opinions, preferences
logic_level: 2-3           # "because" + causal reasoning, past→present→future structure
edge: "Capitals at sentence start (inconsistent); variety of connectors (then, so, but, also); narrative/story writing (fiction); longer compositions"
gaps:
  - "No fiction/narrative writing yet — has retell, informational, and journal"
  - "Capitals at sentence start inconsistent (2/3 in WRITE-0003)"
notes: "Three samples show rapid progression: run-on retell (0001) → run-on original with segments (0002) → sentences with periods (0003). WRITE-0003 is a breakthrough — periods, three tenses (past/present/future), self-reflection. 'Because' is habitual (3 uses). Phonetic errors decreasing. Next: fiction/narrative writing, consistent capitalization."
