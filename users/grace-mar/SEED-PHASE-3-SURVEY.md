# Seed Phase 3 Survey — PILOT-001 (Grace-Mar)

**Purpose:** Map academic/intellectual capabilities to calibrate SKILLS container edges.
**Evidence Tier:** 5 (REPORTED) — parent-reported, upgrades when demonstrated.
**Administration:** Yes/no questions via Cursor chat, one at a time.

## Raw Answers

### Reading & Language (Q1–Q6)

```yaml
q1_all_26_letters: yes
q2_reads_simple_words: yes
q3_reads_sentences: yes
q4_reads_full_page: yes
q5_sounds_out_unfamiliar: yes
q6_retells_stories: yes
```

**Assessment:** Strong reader for first grade. All foundational reading skills present. Can decode independently, comprehend, and reproduce narrative.

### Writing (Q7–Q10)

```yaml
q7_writes_full_name: yes
q8_writes_words_from_memory: yes
q9_writes_sentences: yes
q10_phonetic_spelling: not sure    # EDGE — parent uncertain
```

**Assessment:** Solid writer for age. Produces words and sentences independently. Phonetic/invented spelling is the current edge — may be doing it but parent hasn't confirmed.

### Math & Numbers (Q11–Q14)

```yaml
q11_counts_to_100: yes
q12_single_digit_addition: yes
q13_single_digit_subtraction: yes
q14_tells_time: no                 # EDGE — cannot read a clock yet
```

**Assessment:** Arithmetic fundamentals solid. Counting, addition, subtraction all present. Telling time is a clear next step.

### General Reasoning (Q15–Q16)

```yaml
q15_multi_step_instructions: yes
q16_days_of_week: yes              # Also knows them BACKWARD
```

**Assessment:** Strong sequential reasoning. Knowing days backward indicates internalized understanding, not rote memorization. Can hold and execute multi-step sequences.

**Off-script note (Q16):** "She knows them backward too" — notable signal for sequential/structural thinking.

### Chinese (Q17–Q19)

```yaml
q17_conversational_chinese: yes    # Full back-and-forth conversations
q18_chinese_characters: no         # EDGE — literacy not started
q19_counts_in_chinese: yes         # At least to 10
```

**Assessment:** Strong oral Chinese (daily home use, conversational). Chinese literacy (character recognition/writing) has not begun — clear edge for future development.

### School (Q20)

```yaml
q20_school: first grade
q20_school_type: not specified
```

## Identified Edges

| Domain | Current Capability | Edge (next step) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| READ | Reads pages, sounds out words, retells | Longer independent text, chapter books |
| WRITE | Writes sentences from memory | Phonetic/invented spelling, longer compositions |
| Math | Counts to 100, adds/subtracts | Telling time, place value |
| Chinese oral | Conversational, counts | More complex vocabulary, narrative in Chinese |
| Chinese literacy | None | First character recognition |
| Reasoning | Multi-step, sequential (forward + backward) | Pattern recognition, cause-effect |
