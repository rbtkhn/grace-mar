# Analysis: Homework samples (companion-submitted) — 2026-02-24

**Context:** Five school worksheets submitted as homework samples from Grace-Mar's companion's household. Treated as the child's (Abby's) school work for Record alignment. Source: images provided 2026-02-24.

**Purpose:** Extract knowledge, writing/linguistic, BUILD (drawing + task completion), and personality signals for possible pipeline staging. No merge without approval.

## Sample 1 — WORD WORK: Layer and Crust (Lesson 2 L15c)

**Publisher:** The Every Day Difference, 2020.

**Task:** Earth layers (crust focus). Color the crust on a cross-section diagram; answer "What layer do we live on?"; thumbs up/down for (1) layers of clothing when cold, (2) "Is the crust a layer of magma deep inside the earth?"

**Student response:**
- Written answer: **"Crust"** (neat, all-caps).
- Crust on diagram: lightly shaded with pencil (followed instruction).
- Thumbs: up for "several layers of clothing to keep warm"; down for "crust = magma deep inside."

**Alignment with Record:**
- **IX-A:** Earth layers (crust, mantle, outer core, inner core) already in Record (WRITE-0002, LEARN-0015, school). This sheet **reinforces** crust as "where we live" and correct rejection of crust = magma.
- **WRITE:** Single-word written answer; not a full sentence. Supports vocabulary-in-use (crust).
- **BUILD:** Followed directions (color one layer, circle thumbs); task completion.

**Signals:** Care in handwriting; correct science; light pencil shading. No new knowledge; reinforces existing Earth-science and conscientiousness.

## Sample 2 — WORD WORK: Solid, Mantle, Inner Core (Lesson 3 L15a)

**Task:** Circle something solid (rock vs water vs wind); thumbs up/down for: solids take shape of container? mantle = where we live? inner core = solid metal ball in center?

**Student response:**
- **Rock** circled as solid (correct).
- Thumbs down for "solids take shape of container" (correct).
- Thumbs down for "mantle = where we live" (correct — we live on crust).
- Thumbs up for "inner core = solid metal ball in center" (correct).

**Alignment with Record:**
- **IX-A:** Mantle and inner core already present via Earth layers. This adds **solid vs liquid** (solids don’t take container shape) and **inner core as solid metal ball** — can be staged as knowledge expansion if desired.
- **BUILD:** Task completion; correct circling; no drawing.

**Signals:** All answers correct. Possible **new knowledge** for pipeline: inner core = solid metal ball in center of Earth; solids don’t take the shape of their container.

## Sample 3 — Knowledge 7: The History of the Earth (cover/title page)

**Task:** Title page / cover; name line. Central illustration: child as archaeologist/paleontologist at a table with rocks, crystals, bones, fossil, dinosaur skull (T. rex-style), tools; shovel below. Template colored by student.

**Student response:**
- **Name:** "Abigail" in cursive-like script (neat, legible).
- **Coloring:** Within lines; orange (vest, shirt, shoes), brown (table, hat), varied rock/mineral colors, white/bone skull, grey/green shovel. Careful execution.

**Alignment with Record:**
- **Identity:** Confirms "Abigail" as the child’s name in her own hand (matches grace-mar/Abby).
- **IX-B / interests:** Earth history, fossils, dinosaurs, rocks — aligns with existing curiosity (space, animals, ancient history, science). **New:** explicit "History of the Earth" and paleontology/archaeology framing (bones, skull, tools).
- **BUILD:** Coloring within lines; deliberate color choices; no original drawing, but follows template with care.

**Signals:** Neat handwriting; diligence; interest in Earth history and fossils. Good candidate for **curiosity** (CUR) or **knowledge** (LEARN) if staging: e.g. "History of the Earth / fossils / dinosaurs — school unit; showed interest in bones and dinosaur skull."

## Sample 4 — WORD WORK: Dinosaurs and extinction (Lesson 8 L15c)

**Task:** "How would your life be different today if dinosaurs were not extinct? Write a sentence, then draw a picture to match." Plus definition of "extinct" with thumbs up/down.

**Student response:**
- **Sentence:** "My life would be different because I would be scard to go outside."
  - Spelling: *becasue* (because), *scard* (scared).
- **Drawing:** House (red roof, light brown walls, window, door), brown picket fence, pinkish-red dinosaur with spiky back outside the fence facing the house. Scene illustrates "scared to go outside."

**Alignment with Record:**
- **IX-A:** **Extinct** — definition (no more of that type of animal left on Earth). **New** if not already in Record.
- **IX-C / personality:** Clear **emotional response** to hypothetical: fear → would avoid going outside. Aligns with documented bravery (overcoming fear) and emotional honesty; adds "imagined threat (dinosaurs) → fear, desire for safety (stay inside)."
- **WRITE:** Cause-effect sentence ("because I would be"); phonetic spelling (scard, becasue); first-person hypothetical. **New writing sample** for linguistic style (sentence structure, spelling).
- **BUILD:** Drawing matches sentence; house + fence = safety; dinosaur outside = threat. Narrative coherence between writing and picture.

**Signals:** Strong **self-voice**: personal feeling (fear) and consequence (wouldn’t go outside). **New knowledge:** extinct; **new personality/emotional:** response to hypothetical danger. **New writing:** one sentence + spelling patterns. High value for pipeline (WRITE + LEARN + PER or value).

## Sample 5 — DRAWING THE READ-ALOUD: Time, Heat, Pressure (Lesson 1 W12)

**Task:** Draw 3 details from the read-aloud; write a sentence for each (Time, Heat, Pressure).

**Student response:**
- **Time:** Clock face (numbers, two hands). Sentence: "1. Fire is very bot." (*bot* = hot.) — Sentence is about heat/fire, not time.
- **Heat:** Drawing of a hand (side view). Sentence: "2. When you crush a ball it contains pressure." — Sentence is about pressure, not heat.
- **Pressure:** Small blob-like drawing. Sentence: "3. changes in Earth take a long time." — Sentence is about time/duration, not pressure.

**Alignment with Record:**
- **WRITE:** Three short sentences; phonetic *bot* (hot); "contains" used correctly; "changes in Earth take a long time" = geological time. **Linguistic:** Sentences are content-carrying but **labels (Time/Heat/Pressure) and sentences are mismatched** — she recalled read-aloud content and wrote it, but didn’t align to the three boxes strictly.
- **IX-A:** Fire is hot; crushing a ball → pressure; Earth changes take a long time. General science from read-aloud.
- **Personality/process:** **Associative** — prioritizes recalling and writing what she remembered over strict category matching. Could support an IX-C observation: "recalls and reports learned content; sometimes links to category loosely" (if desired).

**Signals:** Effort to complete all three; spelling (bot); conceptual recall (fire, pressure, Earth time). Mismatch between section labels and sentences is a **reasoning/instruction-following** signal (flexible or loose association) rather than lack of knowledge.

## Recommended next steps (no merge without approval)

1. **Store artifacts:** Save the five images under `users/grace-mar/artifacts/` with clear names (e.g. `SCHOOL-0001-layer-crust.png`, `SCHOOL-0002-solid-mantle-inner-core.png`, etc.) if you want them in the Evidence chain.
2. **Pipeline staging:** If you want these in the Record, stage candidates for:
   - **IX-A:** Extinct (definition); inner core = solid metal ball; History of the Earth / fossils (school unit).
   - **WRITE:** WRITE-0006 (dinosaurs sentence + picture); optional WRITE entry for read-aloud sentences (Time/Heat/Pressure).
   - **IX-C / EVIDENCE:** Emotional response to "dinosaurs not extinct" (fear, stay inside); optional PER for associative task approach (Sample 5).
3. **SESSION-LOG:** Add a session entry for "Companion-submitted homework samples (5 sheets) — analysis 2026-02-24" with link to this file.

If you tell me which of these you want staged (e.g. "stage knowledge and the dinosaur writing only"), I can add concrete PENDING-REVIEW candidates and artifact paths.
