    entry: "I wrote Madeline from memory — Paris, twelve girls, the tiger at the zoo. I drew the Nine-Colored Deer from a Chinese folk tale, Stitch at Lilo's house with a rainbow rug, and Nu-Nu (my stuffie) in the Rocky Mountains. I made up my own ocean with an octopus, fish, and crab. At school I did a Tomb of Pakal collage. I drew myself as an astronaut on the moon, and Egyptian pharaohs and a snowman collage."

    entry: "I learned who George Washington was — the first president. I asked about Jupiter's Great Red Spot, which is a giant storm, and we talked about Mars and Olympus Mons. I discovered gemstones and Abraham Lincoln's stovepipe hat. I heard about The Nutcracker ballet. I wrote about Earth's layers and science, which is my favorite subject, and about spaghetti, pizza, and overcoming my fear of swimming."

    entry: "I learned about reptiles — they have scales, lay eggs, and are cold-blooded. I found out why reptiles can't live on Jupiter — it's all gas! I colored the solar system workbook with Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and moons. At school I painted a pharaoh portrait in King Tut style."

    entry: "I wrote about my sleepover — Barbie and Magic School Bus at school. I explained black holes — gravity so strong it pulls in light. I love reptiles a lot and I like rocks — learning about them and how shiny they are. I picked diamond as my favorite gemstone."
