# skill-work — PILOT-001

Making, planning, execution, exchange, creation.
Part of SKILLS. See [skill-think](skill-think.md), [skill-write](skill-write.md).

**Module intent:** WORK serves as tutor for the companion in the making, planning, execution, and creation domain — proposing activities at the container edge, answering questions, scaffolding next steps, aligned with work goals and life mission. Captures capability from evidence; human-gated.

**Module objectives:**
- Implement and maintain the Grace-Mar Telegram and WeChat bots
- Develop and maintain the Grace-Mar web app at grace-mar.com
- Curate and maintain self-library

## WORK Container

```yaml
status: ACTIVE (creation dimensions from CREATE-0001–0008; planning/execution from ACT-0035 WORK probe)
# Creation (merged from IMAGINE)
originality_level: 4      # original visual interpretation of text-only Chinese story (CREATE-0001); WORK probe confirmed story combo (Deer+Madeline)
elaboration_level: 4      # detailed — careful color banding, shading, decorative elements; WORK probe confirmed (scarf, eyelashes, whole world)
flexibility_level: 3      # works within story framework but makes own visual choices; WORK probe confirmed (add one thing not in book)
# Planning/execution (evidenced by WORK probe ACT-0035)
planning_level: 1-2       # can order steps for familiar tasks (drawing: get materials first; lemonade stand: lemonade first)
execution_level: 1        # next step in sequence (Lego: go to step 5 after step 4)
making_level: 1           # follows instructions + looks at box (Legos — methodical)
financial_level: null
collaboration_level: null
decision_making: 1        # can give reason for choice (why pick deer: kind, brave, beautiful)
edge: "Narrative creation from prompts; cross-language creative tasks; independent scene composition; planning/execution evidenced via WORK probe (step order, next step, making method)"
gaps: []
notes: "Creation: CREATE-0001–0008 show strong creation capability. WORK probe (2026-02-24, ACT-0035): planning (step order), execution (next step), making (Legos instructions+box), elaboration/flexibility/originality/decision_making confirmed. Human gates all merges."

# Companion creative context (part of WORK — household/companion artistic style)
companion_creative_context:
  source: ACT-0036 (Companion artistic style survey, 2026-02-24)
  primary_medium: pencil, pen, or marker on paper
  frequency: most days
  finishing: finishes pieces
  sharing: shares work
  learning_style: mixed (depends on skill and time)
  framing: does not think in terms of "art" — just makes things
  color_vs_form: both equally
  environment: prefers silence when creating
  one_word_style: playful
  note: "Companion's artistic style is part of WORK context; informs household creative environment."

## SCHOOL (contextual)

```yaml
grade: first grade
school_type: not specified
```

---

## WORK GOALS

Companion's own objectives for making, planning, execution, creation. Gated; evidence-linked when captured.

```yaml
work_goals:
  near_term: []    # e.g. "finish X", "learn Y"
  horizon:
    - "SAT score ≥ 1200"
  source: null     # evidence ID when goals captured
```

---

## LIFE MISSION REF

Life mission lives in SELF (identity, values). WORK goals align with it.

```yaml
life_mission_ref: "self.md § VI VALUES (life_mission)"
```
