| How often you make things | **A** — Most days |
| What gets you started | *skipped* |
| Finishing vs. leaving open | **A** — Finish it; I like completed pieces |
| Sharing your work | **A** — Share it (show someone, post, give away) |
| Learning new art skills | **E** — Mix; depends on skill and time |
| Your art vs. "real" art | **D** — I don't think in terms of "art"; I just make things |
| Color vs. line/form | **C** — Both equally |
| Music or sound while creating | **B** — Prefer silence or very quiet |
