# Coffee

**Preferred activation (operator):** say **`coffee`**. Legacy **`hey`** still works as a compatibility alias, but **`coffee`** is the canonical trigger now.

**Signing-off intent** (end of session, wrapping the day, stepping away) uses the **same** **`coffee`** trigger and the **same** **A, B, C, D, E** hub menu. There is **no** separate closeout branch or closeout-only menu item. **Step 1** switches to handoff-weighted output when intent is signing off; **Step 2** is unchanged.

`coffee` is not a startup ceremony. `coffee` is a **repeatable sip of coherence**.

Its purpose is to help the operator become more awake to the actual situation, more coherent about priorities, and more directed about the next move. A coffee session does not need to complete the day's thinking. It only needs to improve orientation enough that action becomes easier.

Multiple `coffee` sessions per day are normal. That is not redundancy; it is the point. Each `coffee` is another sip.

**Coffee Hub Menu (terminology):** **`coffee` Step 2** fixed **A–E** hub (**Steward / Engineer / Historian / Capitalist / Conductor**) is the **Coffee Hub Menu**. When routing continues into **Conductor**, resolution uses the **Master Selection Menu** (masters **A.–E.** — Toscanini … Bernstein) and then typically the **Conductor Action Menu** (five repo-grounded next moves — [CONDUCTOR-PASS — Conductor action MCQ](../../../docs/skill-work/work-coffee/CONDUCTOR-PASS.md#conductor-action-mcq)). Layer map: [CONDUCTOR-LAYER-MAP.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-coffee/CONDUCTOR-LAYER-MAP.md).

## Guardrails

- Do not turn `coffee` into a heavy maintenance ritual by default.
- Do not overload each run with every possible obligation or stale thread.
- Prefer a small number of salient next paths over exhaustive review.
- Keep the operator in the position of renewed agency, not procedural burden.
- `coffee` is for orientation; heavier consolidation belongs to `dream`.
- This is read-only planning. Do not merge or stage just because the warmup mentions candidates.
- If integrity fails, surface that before optional improvements.
- **Contextual stewardship:** Agents have no cross-thread institutional memory; authority for the Record is **on-disk files + gated pipeline** — not model recall or chat summary.

## Relation to dream

`coffee` and `dream` form a biological-cognitive pair:
- **`coffee`** = repeated framing dose (many per day)
- **`dream`** = end-of-day consolidation pass (usually once)

`coffee` should feel like a sip. `dream` should feel like sleep. See `.cursor/skills/dream/SKILL.md` § *Cadence choreography* for the day's sequence and data handoff.

<a id="conductor-only-no-coffee"></a>

## Conductor session (outside `coffee` hub menu)

Use this path when the operator wants **Conductor** **without** going through **`coffee` Step 2 hub letter E**.

The **five masters** (**Toscanini**, **Furtwängler**, **Karajan**, **Kleiber**, **Bernstein**) are **not** listed as separate lines on the **`coffee`** hub — hub **E** is the **single** in-`coffee` slot for **Conductor continuation** after **`coffee`** Step 1. Call masters **directly** (this section) when **`coffee`** was not opened or when the operator prefers **`conductor`** / master name **instead** of **`coffee`**.

**Triggers (examples):** master name or prefix (**`toscanini`**, **`karajan`**, **`bernstein`**, **`kleib`**, …), **`conductor`** with optional fragment, or plain language (**"Bernstein pass"**, **"run Kleiber on the notebook"**). If intent is unclear, ask once. **Legacy:** bare **`D`** + fragment still resolves like a conductor turn when the message is clearly conductor-only (no **`coffee`**).

**Do not** run `operator_coffee.py`, **do not** paste work-start or closeout **Step 1** output, and **do not** lead with **Recent rhythm** — unless the same message also says **`coffee`** or **`hey`**.

**Standalone Conductor** (no **`coffee`** in this turn): show **`build_conductor_mcq_for_user('grace-mar')`** when the master is **not** yet disambiguated; resolve via `resolve_d_conductor` + [work-cadence-events.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-cadence/work-cadence-events.md).

**After `conductor=<slug>` resolves** (standalone pick **or** **`coffee` hub E** auto-continue per [**§ Hub E**](#hub-e-auto-continue)): deliver the **short** orientation in [CONDUCTOR-PASS.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-coffee/CONDUCTOR-PASS.md) and [COFFEE-CADENCE-CONDUCTOR-PROTOCOL.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-strategy/strategy-notebook/COFFEE-CADENCE-CONDUCTOR-PROTOCOL.md). **Then, always** deliver the **Conductor action MCQ** — **five** **A.–E.** repo-grounded next moves — per [CONDUCTOR-PASS — Conductor action MCQ](../../../docs/skill-work/work-coffee/CONDUCTOR-PASS.md#conductor-action-mcq) and [conductor skill](../conductor/SKILL.md). **Skip** the action menu **only** if the operator said **"orientation only"** / **"no action menu"** in the same turn.

**Logging:** `log_cadence_event.py --kind coffee_pick -u grace-mar --ok --kv picked=conductor conductor=<slug>` (e.g. `karajan`, `toscanini`). **Legacy** lines may still use `picked=D`; both are fine for rollups. **`coffee` hub letter E** uses **`picked=E conductor=<slug>`** with **`<slug>`** the resolved conductor (**auto-continued** **or** chosen after Masters MCQ) — see [§ Cadence audit](#cadence-audit). **Do not** append a separate **`coffee`** event unless they actually ran `coffee` Step 1.

**Conductor close (optimal loop):** Same as before — [CONDUCTOR-CLOSE-TEMPLATE.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-strategy/strategy-notebook/CONDUCTOR-CLOSE-TEMPLATE.md) in **`days.md`** / page **Reflection**, or **`coffee_conductor_outcome`** — [CONDUCTOR-IMPROVEMENT-LOOP.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-strategy/strategy-notebook/CONDUCTOR-IMPROVEMENT-LOOP.md).

**After the reply:** return to **normal workflow** unless the operator says **`stay in coffee`** or **`coffee`**.

<a id="hub-e-auto-continue"></a>

**Hub E (`coffee` Step 2) — automatic continuation:** When the operator chooses **E — Conductor** after **`coffee`** Step 1, **`last_logged_conductor`** from cadence (**`coffee_pick`** with **`conductor=`** — same SSOT as **`format_coffee_hub_e_line`**) is the **default resolved slug**.

- **If a slug exists:** **Continue that master immediately** — short orientation + **Conductor action MCQ** for that slug. **Do not** paste the **Masters MCQ** (`build_conductor_mcq_for_user`) row **unless** the operator asks to switch masters in the same turn (e.g. master name / prefix, “masters”, “pick a card”, “switch”) **or** cadence has **no** qualifying prior conductor.
- **If no slug exists:** Paste **`build_conductor_mcq_for_user('grace-mar')`** **or** prompt once for master name / **`conductor`** — **do not** invent a default.

Optional **one line** after auto-continue prose: *Say a master name or “masters” to open the five-master row instead.*

**Letter-collision:** If both the **coffee hub** and a **Conductor action MCQ** appear in one reply, **label** them — e.g. **`Coffee hub — Reply A–E`** vs **`Conductor action MCQ — Reply A–E (this pass)`** — and never use bare “pick **E**” without naming which menu ([CONDUCTOR-PASS.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-coffee/CONDUCTOR-PASS.md)).

---

## "Coffee" = start here (two steps)

When the operator begins with **`coffee`** (or clearly the same intent; legacy **`hey`** still counts), treat it as opening a **coffee session**.

### Step 0 — Recent rhythm (before Step 1 scripts)

**Read first** — `operator_coffee.py` appends a new **`coffee`** line at the **end** of a successful run, so the log must be read **before** those commands if the rhythm read is to exclude this session.

1. Open **`docs/skill-work/work-cadence/work-cadence-events.md`**. Below `_(Append below this line.)_`, collect lines matching `- **YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC** — kind (user) …`.
2. Take the **last 4** such lines already in the file. If there are fewer than four, use what exists; if none, **Recent rhythm:** _(no prior events)_ in the reply.
3. **Synthesize in plain prose** — **2–4 short sentences** for a human, **not** a telemetry dump: **do not** lead with a wall of `key=value` pairs. **Companion-facing UX:** label this block **Recent rhythm** (or prose only); **do not** put **dates, UTC, or clock times** in this prose (use order and light anchors like “after dream,” “then bridge,” “earlier today” without timestamps). **Must anchor in specifics** from those four lines — name what actually happened (e.g. **bridge** with **commit refs** if present, **coffee** **work-start** vs **standard**, **coffee_pick** / **conductor** when present, legacy **`thanks`** **park** text when non-empty, **dream** pass/fail or integrity/governance in ordinary words, **harvest** packet vs not). **Avoid** generic process filler that could apply without reading the file. Do **not** paste raw log lines unless they are already very short.

   **Cadence voice:** Follow the **cadence voice principle** ([work-cadence README](../../../docs/skill-work/work-cadence/README.md#cadence-voice-principle-all-rituals)). Lead with *felt* acknowledgment of what was settled or decided, end with the **optimal next direction**. Use **"we"** framing. The operator should feel **seen, grounded, and ready** — not debriefed. Name what was learned or decided, not what was executed. No commit hashes, no process names — warm, direct, future-facing.
4. In the reply, place **Recent rhythm:** at the **top** of Step 1 content (immediately before script output / warmup paste). Same rule for **signing-off** Step 1 (before `operator_coffee.py --mode closeout` or handoff-only flow).

If the file is missing or empty below the anchor, state that under **Recent rhythm** and continue Step 1.

### Step 1 — Automated actions (one flow, two weights)

**Detect intent**

- **Signing off / closeout / end of session / wrapping the day** → use **closeout-weighted Step 1** below.
- Otherwise → **work-start Step 1** (scale with explicit phrases or weekday cadence).

**Work-start Step 1** — run the consolidated coffee script (preferred):

```bash
python3 scripts/operator_coffee.py -u grace-mar                   # work-start (default)
python3 scripts/operator_coffee.py -u grace-mar --mode light      # lighter pass
python3 scripts/operator_coffee.py -u grace-mar --mode minimal    # compact harness only
python3 scripts/operator_coffee.py -u grace-mar --mode reentry    # cold-thread full stack
```

**Signing-off Step 1** — handoff-weighted (same trigger **`coffee`**, not a second ritual name):

```bash
python3 scripts/operator_coffee.py -u grace-mar --mode closeout
```

Or directly: `python3 scripts/operator_handoff_check.py -u grace-mar`. Include the output in your reply. Add a **short paragraph**: what moved today, what is parked, gate + Jiang carryovers, suggested re-entry prompt. Full spec: [`.cursor/skills/handoff-check/SKILL.md`](../handoff-check/SKILL.md).

If the operator **explicitly** wants **both** full warmup **and** signing-off in one message, run work-start then append handoff (rare).

Add `--compact` for shorter harness output. Individual scripts (`operator_daily_warmup.py`, `harness_warmup.py`, `operator_handoff_check.py`, `operator_reentry_stack.py`) are still available.

**Dream handoff:** If `dream` ran overnight, the daily warmup includes a last-dream block from `users/grace-mar/last-dream.json` (**"Last dream (night handoff)"** when there is something to read out, or a **one-line "quiet handoff"** when `integrity` / `governance` / digest counts are clean and there are no followups). A successful dream may add **`last_coffee_echo`**: a single warm line (from the 24h cadence rollup) that ties yesterday’s `coffee` into morning startup—**cadence / runtime only**, not Record. **Signal days** (issues, followups, or non-zero digests) still use the fuller collapsed block. Extra lines (civ-mem summary, coffee 24h rollup) are **off** by default; tune `config/context_budgets/coffee.json` or pass `--show-civ-mem` / `--show-rollup` on `operator_daily_warmup.py`, `operator_coffee.py`, or `operator_reentry_stack.py`. After that block (or alone if the Last dream section is turned off), warmup prints one line **`Dream → coffee menu:`** mapping dream’s suggested execution path to **A / B / C** (**Steward / Engineer / Historian**) — operational hint only; see [dream/SKILL.md](../dream/SKILL.md) § *Five-second closeout*. Approximate paste footprint: `python3 scripts/audit_context_tax.py -u grace-mar`. These files are operator scaffolding, not Record. For full paths / snippets / followups, use **`--verbose-dream`**. When pasting warmup for the operator, prefer **collapsed** unless they ask for detail.

**Step 1 deliverables (work-start):** Warmup brief (priorities, gate, work-politics snapshot where relevant, integrity), branch snapshot, daily brief + intel defer line (path pattern + **menu C — Historian** when ready), optional PH/Jiang line. **No** Polymarket / poll / Massie blocks in Step 1 unless the operator explicitly asked in the same message.

**Step 1 guardrail:** Stay read-only — no merge/stage unless they switch lanes or use a pipeline phrase ("we …").

**Done when:** Script output is pasted in the reply, Recent rhythm is at the top, and the full coffee menu follows immediately.

For cadence tables and explicit phrase definitions (`coffee light`, `coffee minimal`, `coffee survey`): see [menu-reference.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-coffee/menu-reference.md).

### Multiple coffees per day

The operator may say **`coffee`** **more than once per calendar day** for reorientation. This is normal. Each new `coffee` runs Step 1 again and starts a new **A, B, C, D, E** cycle. If **`coffee`** arrives mid-hub, treat it as a **reorientation restart**: run Step 1 again, then offer a fresh menu.

<a id="coffee-step-2-hub"></a>

### Step 2 — Hub menu (five lines only)

Immediately **after** Step 1 content, output the **hub** menu — **five lines** (**A–E**).

**One option per line:** Each hub letter is **its own line** — **`A.` … `E.`** as **five separate lines**, not multiple letters on one line and not a single paragraph listing A–E. (Sub-menus inside **D** **Capitalist** forks or **Steward** branches are separate from this rule when you open a follow-up.)

**Letter-collision:** The **Symphony masters** disambiguation row (**masters A.–E.**) and the **Conductor action MCQ** (**five actions A.–E.** for the resolved slug) use **the same letter range** as the hub. When **both** a **coffee hub** menu and a **Conductor action MCQ** could appear in one reply, **label** them explicitly — see [CONDUCTOR-PASS.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-coffee/CONDUCTOR-PASS.md). **Do not** reuse bare “pick **E**” without naming which menu.

**Do not** append the **masters** **MCQ** row **under** the five hub lines; masters disambiguation belongs to **Conductor** turns ([§ Conductor session (outside `coffee` hub menu)](#conductor-only-no-coffee), [CONDUCTOR-PASS.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-coffee/CONDUCTOR-PASS.md)). **After hub E is chosen:** when **`last_logged_conductor`** resolves, **skip** the **Masters MCQ** — deliver orientation + **Conductor action MCQ** immediately ([**§ Hub E — automatic continuation**](#hub-e-auto-continue)).

**Do not** add micro-hints, fork shorthand, or F/G/Xavier/Dev tags **under** the hub list.

**Hub menu (example):**

```
A. Steward
B. Engineer
C. Historian
D. Capitalist — <one short line: work-business / grace-gems / commercial angle / bookshelf: knowledge MCQs vs stance membrane per § Capitalist bookshelf>
E. Conductor — last master: **Bernstein** (`bernstein`)  ← use live text from Step 1 (`format_coffee_hub_e_line`; see below), not a placeholder
```

**Hub line E (required wording):** Paste the **`Coffee hub Step 2 — hub **E** continuity`** line from **`operator_coffee.py`** Step 1 output (`format_coffee_hub_e_line` in [cadence_conductor_resolution.py](../../../scripts/cadence_conductor_resolution.py)) — **always** includes **last master display name + slug** when a qualifying `coffee_pick` exists; otherwise the no-prior line. **Do not** emit bare **E — Conductor** without that continuity string when Step 1 printed it.

**Filling D — Capitalist:** **work-business**, **grace-gems**, revenue/offers framing; **work-cici** when business/teaching-commercial; one prescribed next step. **Alternate lens:** match **`Dream → coffee menu`** when it points at a path not already covered by **A–C**.

**Capitalist — bookshelf / self-knowledge (two branches):**

1. **Topic-anchored knowledge MCQs (default for “quiz” / recursion)** — [.cursor/skills/bookshelf-knowledge-mcq-to-gate/SKILL.md](../bookshelf-knowledge-mcq-to-gate/SKILL.md): historical **fact-and-mechanism** probes with evidence anchors toward IX-A `Knows:` lines. **Suggest this liberally** in suitable WORK turns. **Formatting:** **each letter option on its own line**; **at most two date-primary questions per round** (see skill).
2. **Catalog stance membrane** (subject-tag affiliation: `bookshelf-membrane-round.json` + `build_bookshelf_membrane_candidates.py`) — **secondary** use only — when the operator requests it **or** a **pressing** catalog/membrane issue requires that stance map **not** as a substitute for knowledge MCQs.

**Fixed option (Capitalist angle, hub line wording):** may read **Bookshelf quiz — knowledge MCQs → gate skill** **or** **Bookshelf stance membrane (scripted)** depending on intent.

**Catalog stance membrane (scripted path only — branch 2 above):**

- Session is **multi-round**: 5–10 MCQs per round when using the scripted stance round artifact.
- After each round, ask continue/stop.
- On stop, produce:
  - `docs/skill-work/work-strategy/history-notebook/research/BOOKSHELF-MEMBRANE-REPORT.md`
  - `docs/skill-work/work-strategy/history-notebook/research/BOOKSHELF-MEMBRANE-CANDIDATE-DRAFTS.md`
- Output is draft-only; no direct writes to `users/grace-mar/recursion-gate.md` unless explicitly requested.

**Write-shaped** work is **not** an extra letter — it defaults under **D** when skill-write/commercial, or when the operator says **`write`** / **`skill-write`** without **`coffee`**. State it plainly in the angle-bracket line; **do not** add a separate “micro-hints” row.

**Filling E — Conductor:** Hub line matches **`format_coffee_hub_e_line`**. **When the operator picks hub E:** **[`last_logged_conductor`](#hub-e-auto-continue)** **defaults** the session — **orientation + Conductor action MCQ** for that slug **without** interposing the **Masters MCQ**, unless cadence has **no** prior **`coffee_pick` `conductor=`** **or** the operator asks to switch masters (name / “masters” / “pick a card”). **If no slug:** paste **`build_conductor_mcq_for_user`** **or** prompt once — **do not** invent a default master.

**Step 1 context for B / D:** `operator_coffee.py` prints **`Lane context (for hub B / D — Engineer & Capitalist hints)`** — two lines from `scripts/coffee_lane_next_hints.py` (work-cici + work-dev). Use when choosing **B**, **D**, or when wording those lines.

**Step 1 context for hub E:** After lane hints, **`operator_coffee.py`** prints **`Coffee hub Step 2 — hub **E** continuity`** — one line to paste verbatim as hub **E** in Step 2 (last master from cadence).

**Optional load note:** Step 1 may print `Session load: … (recommended: X)` (**A** / **B** / **C**). You may mention that **one** recommended hub letter in prose before or after the menu. For **Conductor** emphasis outside the hub, say **once** that **`conductor`** / master name works **without** opening **`coffee`** ([§ Conductor session](#conductor-only-no-coffee)). **Not** micro-hints under the hub list.

**Quick reference (modes):**

- **A. Steward** — **Governance membrane:** **gate** \| **template/boundary** \| **integrity/exports** \| **git/ship**. **Default if the operator says `A` only:** **gate** if pending candidates; else **template/boundary**. **`A integrity`** / **`A git`** / **`A ship`** → that track; **`A both`** / **`A all`** as in [menu-reference — Steward](../../../docs/skill-work/work-coffee/menu-reference.md#ah-table). Gate merges never without companion **approve** + `process_approved_candidates.py`. *(Legacy hub letter **B**.)*

- **B. Engineer** — **work-dev + skills/meta** (not git/ship or full membrane audits — those are **A**): `docs/skill-work/work-dev/` + [work-dev-sources.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-dev/work-dev-sources.md); **skills / meta** when **`skills`** / **`meta`** with **B**. **work-cici** ops when engineering-shaped. **When hub B is chosen:** After **one short orientation line**, deliver **Engineer next moves** — **3–5 options** labeled **A through E** (**or A–D** if four), **each option its own line**, under an explicit heading such as **`Engineer menu — reply A–E`** — **not** `B1`–`B5` and not unlabeled lists. Each new submenu **restarts letters from A**; disambiguate from the **Coffee hub** with the menu title (same idea as **letter-collision** labeling for Conductor action MCQ vs hub). Each line is a **repo-grounded** plausible next step (work-dev wedge, script, CI, **skills** path) — **enumeration only** until the operator picks. Use Step 1 **`Lane context (for hub B / D)`** and [workspace.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-dev/workspace.md) § **Next actions** when helpful. **Detail:** [menu-reference § Engineer (B) — detailed scope](../../../docs/skill-work/work-coffee/menu-reference.md#build-b--detailed-scope) *(legacy letter **Build** / old hub **A**).*

- **C. Historian** — **Two-stage flow (default; do not collapse to intel-only):** **(1)** Daily brief path — generator and/or `daily-brief-YYYY-MM-DD.md`, **§1d** / **§1e** / **§1g** / **§1h** (PRC / IRI when load-bearing), optional **KY-4** (Polymarket, polls, Massie X per cadence). **(2)** In the **same turn**, offer **Tri-Frame** minds **Barnes → Mearsheimer → Mercouris**, wait for **which mind**, then [daily-brief-minds-menu.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-strategy/daily-brief-minds-menu.md). **Do not** end **C** on polls alone unless **`intel only`** / **`no tri-frame`** / survey-only. **Broader spine:** pointers into strategy-notebook, work-jiang / Predictive History, self-library reads — **no** invented `work-history/` lane folder. **Companion survey** when **`coffee survey`**. See [menu-reference — Tri-Frame](../../../docs/skill-work/work-coffee/menu-reference.md#tri-frame-daily-brief). *(Legacy hub **C — Strategy (daily brief)**.)*

- **D. Capitalist** — **work-business**, **grace-gems**, revenue/offers; **work-cici** when business/teaching-commercial angle; **bookshelf: knowledge MCQs (default)** vs **catalog stance membrane (secondary)** — see **[Capitalist — bookshelf / self-knowledge]** above; **one** prescribed next step.

- **E. Conductor** — **`coffee` hub E** **[auto-continues](#hub-e-auto-continue)** **`last_logged_conductor`** (orientation + **Conductor action MCQ**); **hub line** shows last master via **`format_coffee_hub_e_line`** / Step 1 paste. **Not** a substitute for standalone **`conductor`** when **`coffee`** was not invoked.

**Exit / re-offer:** After **A**, **B**, **D**, or **E**, re-offer the full **A–E** menu by default. After **C**, **exit to normal workflow** unless **`stay in coffee`**. After **A** (Steward), see [menu-reference § Steward follow-up fork](../../../docs/skill-work/work-coffee/menu-reference.md#steward-follow-up-fork-implement-now-vs-later) *(legacy docs may still say **B** for Steward — read **A**).* Synonyms **`A+ship`** / **`EXECUTE`** ≈ **Implement now** on steward track.

Legacy **A–G** detail tables in [menu-reference.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-coffee/menu-reference.md) still describe **workloads**; map letters: old **Daily Brief → C**, **Build → B**, **Steward → A**, **Compass/Book/F/G** → **D** or **C** as appropriate; **Symphony conductors** → **E** on hub after **`coffee`**, or **standalone** **`conductor`** / master name without **`coffee`**.

**Done when:** The operator has picked **A–E** (or combo), the selected branch has been executed, and the re-offer or exit rule has been applied.

## Session trail (optional)

Sessions begin when the operator says **`coffee`** (optional modifiers). To keep a trail: use **`users/<id>/session-transcript.md`** and/or append dated bullets to **`docs/skill-work/work-*/*-history.md`**. **Not** the gated Record; **not** `self-memory`. See [work-menu-conventions.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-menu-conventions.md).

<a id="cadence-audit"></a>

## Cadence audit

Each successful coffee run appends one line to `docs/skill-work/work-cadence/work-cadence-events.md` via `scripts/log_cadence_event.py`. This is automatic — no operator action required. The line always includes **`cursor_model=…`** (audit parity with bridge/harvest **Agent surface**): set **`CURSOR_MODEL`** in the environment, or pass **`--cursor-model "…"`** to `operator_coffee.py`, using the model name from the Cursor UI. If unset, **`unknown`**.

**After the operator states their menu letter** (and steward track if **A**), the assistant may append a **`coffee_pick`** cadence line (same file) for rollup:  
`python3 scripts/log_cadence_event.py --kind coffee_pick -u grace-mar --ok --kv picked=A steward=gate --cursor-model "<from Cursor UI>"`  
(`steward=` only when `picked=A`; values: `gate`, `template`, `integrity`, `git`, `both`, or `all`.) For **hub** picks: **`picked=A`..`E`**. **`picked=E`** should include **`conductor=<slug>`** when the Conductor master is resolved. For **Conductor sessions** outside hub letter picks: **`picked=conductor`** with **`conductor=<single-slug>`** — **no** `+` in new logs. Legacy files may still contain **`picked=D`** + `conductor=` or older shapes. **Optional closure after a conductor run:** `python3 scripts/log_cadence_event.py --kind coffee_conductor_outcome -u grace-mar --ok --kv verdict=watch` (see [CONDUCTOR-IMPROVEMENT-LOOP.md](../../../docs/skill-work/work-strategy/strategy-notebook/CONDUCTOR-IMPROVEMENT-LOOP.md) § 3 for `notebook_ref` / `falsify` examples). Optional: `scripts/log_operator_choice.py --context COFFEE --picked A` for `session-transcript.md`.
